# Chapter Three - Backup Attack

*"The election of 2020 was not counted, it was calculated."*

—Draza Smith, mathmetician

For those asking - the Edison data reports the cumulative votes and the percentage that each candidate has during the election. But - during the Nov 2020 election, these reporting values all went through a rolling zero that then returned to relatively the same values on the next reporting cycle. It happened in series to each state and DC.  I suspect that this was application of new setpoints and/or new control constants to drive the vote totals to the setpoint within the number of votes remaining in the count.

From Erin:
I'd recommend watching the first part of the Otero County Commission meeting we did a few weeks ago and using some of those talking points from Mr. Lenburg. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg6Gf6QjqGM&t=939s

If the Attack Phase fails, the Backup Attack Phase comes into play.

This is the part where the narrative up till this point begins to take an interesting turn which may shake your previous understanding of how elections work.

For all the years of my life until 2020, I thought my vote counted. Then, in late 2020, I realized it probably didn't, but I didn't know how exactly.

Then, sometime in 2021, when I was introduced to Draza Smith's work and later met her at the Cyber Symposium, my perspective changed dramatically. As Draza put it well: "The election of 2020 was not counted, it was calculated."

Start with an electoral college map of the United States. To win the presidential election takes 270 electoral college votes. Then, use a PID controller to generate outcomes at the state level in such a way that the desired candidate wins.

Easier said than done, because you don't know how many voters will turn out, either for the desired candidate or for the undesired candidate.

It's possible that the original set point in each state might need to be adjusted to get the desired outcome. Is this why vote counting needed to suddenly stop in multiple states in the middle of the night?

Erin Clements recommended I have a look at Draza's analysis of the Rhode Island cast vote record (CVR) and compare it with what Edison played on TV. Reason being that it was the "best synopsis of the set point phenomenon and the shuffle because that's the only place where we have apples to apples comparison between what we were told was happening on election night and what's actually stored inside the computer system—they can't be reconciled."

For background on Edison data, recall this chart from Russ Ramsland's Georgia presentation in December 2020.

![Edison receives data from "Unofficial Database"](Russ_Ramsland_Presentation_Georgia_State_House_Elections_Hearing)

On [Draza Smith's Telegram channel](https://t.me/ladydraza), all of the following charts and descriptions can be found by using the search function and typing "Rhode Island".

On August 3, 2021 Draza said: "So - Rhode Island is one of the more surprising plots I have seen so far. During the entire election reporting, the ratio of votes was on the Trump side of the line...until they were slammed down into their setpoint...

![Rhode Island Edison Data](rhode_island_2021_1.jpeg)

"Looking at the total vote trend, there was a clear preference, until that pesky Edison zero reset...."

![Set Point Reset](rhode_island_2021_2.jpeg)

"From the Edison reported percentages, you can see the HUGE spike in the Biden votes prior to the reset, which has been indicative of receiving a new setpoint and higher tuning constants."

![Spike in Biden votes prior to reset](rhode_island_2021_3.jpeg)

"For those asking - the Edison data reports the cumulative votes and the percentage that each candidate has during the election. But - during the Nov 2020 election, these reporting values all went through a rolling zero that then returned to relatively the same values on the next reporting cycle. It happened in series to each state and DC.  I suspect that this was application of new setpoints and/or new control constants to drive the vote totals to the setpoint within the number of votes remaining in the count."

![Setpoint Driven from 97% to 66%](rhode_island_2021_4.jpeg)

"In the data you can see it happen here. The ratio setpoint is driven from 97% to 66% and the Edison zero happens 4 minutes later."

Then, on the 21st of May, 2022, Draza announced this:

"I am so grateful our smallest state today. Because the entire state is smaller than many counties in other states, they do things a little more efficiently there, including counting all of their statewide votes with a single system that produces a STATEWIDE CVR.

"So, I have been saying for a while now that I have been confused about the fact that none of our counties/precincts can give a good explanation of how Edison and Scytl and SP are getting the election data to the NYT, etc. for election night reporting and CALLING THE RACES ON!

"But, I believe these companies know the playbook and just provide a probabilistic model to the viewers at home - so how can you question the results? You watched them come in live on TV! All the while the mules and machines and NGO's with electronic access to the voter rolls/poll books are working magic on the real votes have them end in the same place."

![Trump to Biden ratio on election night](rhode_island_2022_1.jpeg)

"So, here is the results as we saw them election night for the State of Rhode Island! This is how the ratio of Trump to Biden votes were reported by the news to all of us sitting at home on election night.

"That Drop towards Biden looks a little funny right there after FL was called for Trump, doesn't it?"

![Trump and Biden votes on election night](rhode_island_2022_2.jpeg)

"Here are the actual votes for each candidate that were reported over time. Did you realize little Rhode Island had their very own "F curve"?

"Well, actually it looks kind of like a snake in the grass..."

"So - now we have the CVR data to see what the MACHINE says about how the votes counted up. Before I show the plot, remember what we have learned through the work by Jeff O'Donnell on finding the two sets of books in the database. And my theory that they reshuffle the database to push those muled in votes that come in just under the wire forward in time to make it look like they were always there.

"This produces a distinctive curve with a drop and then a scoop (which Dr. D has termed the "Biden Boost" and then the votes float back upwards to the final setpoint, with corrections here and there. Right?

"Well, even here in RI where it would be totally obvious, the machines could not help themselves. It is in their code."

![Rhode Island - How the votes actually came in](rhode_island_2022_3.jpeg)

"So - here is what the machine told us with the CVR report of how the ratio of votes ACTUALLY *cough, cough* came in for Rhode Island over time.

"The blue graph below shows the precinct index that each ballot came in from. This is  term I have developed for places that do not have numbered precincts. I take the list of precincts and record the precincts in order as they show up as precincts 1,2,3... and then I can plot them. Anyone that is interested - I can provide you my precinct name-to-number key.

"But what is notable here is - just like in other places, ALL the precincts report in at the very beginning (REPRESENT!) and then are shuffled to look almost too perfectly randomized with keeping some from every precinct in the back pocket to add at the end of counting.

"But - remember - if we were getting in votes perfectly randomized from all over the state - would the Law of Large Numbers dictate that this rollercoaster would be the shape we would expect?"

![Trump and Biden votes in CVR](rhode_island_2022_4.jpeg)

"And - if you could possible believe it, just look how evenly over time the votes came in for each candidate!! No snakes in the grass here...just in the programmers' seats."

"And - believe it or not - those RI Patriots collected more data - interim reports of vote counts, etc. NOTHING MATCHES, not the news data, to the machine data to the SecState data - sure , they all end up in the same place after a month or 2 of making 'corrections'."

![Edison corrections](rhode_island_2022_5.jpeg)

"Check out the corrections that the Edison data made to get to the final results - after over a month worth of "corrections and updates" - because this is how we should count election votes.

"P.S: I dropped out the reported vote from the AP that wasn't Edison because they appear to not have ben synchronized and make even more crazy jumps, as a result."

***

## Minnesota's Simulation

No Minnesotan has been given any cast vote records from their county and it is hard to say whether any counties actually have them, for various reasons. Not being able to produce an audit trail of the machine count, when the machine count is the primary method of counting, is unacceptable.

Since we do not have the cast vote records from any county, let alone the entire state as Rhode Island was able to produce, let's make do with what we can.

Let's start take a look at how votes were reported to the media (refer back to Russ Ramsland's slide above for reference). The following graphic shows how the votes were sent through to the media from Edison Research. Notice the negative 194,846 votes near interval 50. In a system that is aggregating votes, should there ever be a drop in nearly 200,000 votes? What may have caused that?

Here again I will quote Draza Smith:

"So - Minnesota had some really interesting things going on that took a little bit of thought. I am finding a lot of events that happen across states that help me try to convince all of you our elections are completely controlled events. Minnesota - I believe - kinda went like this:"

![Minnesota Total Votes](MinnesotaPercentageControl.JPG)

"The overall votes have a very high correlation with an R value of 0.9978, which is higher than Pennsylvania, but Pennsylvania was the states that had the same "event" happen, with regard to the loss of votes during counting. I pulled up the similar curve from Pennsylvania and, not only is the shape factor almost exactly the same, but it happened during almost the same counting interval number - around 50 - which, timewise, was shortly after the Florida surprise."

![Comparing MN to PA](MN-PA-Compare.JPG)

"The difference in the shape that follows whatever was happening that caused the similarity between the events in PA and MN is the result of the difference in the initial perturbation that was assigned to each state. PA had one that was more chaotic that MN."

![Setpoint Input Process](setpoint.jpeg)

"The "setpoint change" that appears to occur later on is most likely the result of a slight shifting in position as MI was being moved in the lineup. I refer to this as a setpoint change, because it bears a striking resemblance to what we would see in any industrial system that is being controlled and experiences a setpoint change. This is the image that I used on the graph above that - should - have nothing to do with elections."

When Draza refers to MI (Michigan) being moved in the lineup, consider that since Florida's Trump turnout was so high the algorithm was not going to be set in such a way to achieve a Biden win. It appears the decision was made by the powers that be to let Trump win Florida but pick up those electoral college votes elsewhere. Thus Michigan being moved in the lineup.

![National Key for Setpoints](setpoint_national.png)

"If we go back and look at the national key calculated from the final values, you can see that MN is right there at the edge of the shuffle - and probably was affected by the moving of MI into the Biden side of the curve."

![Ratio of Trump to Biden votes](MN_trump_biden.png)

"Here you can see the ratio control curve with a bit of a chaotic start and that "event" after Florida was called. But, after she got her final setpoint, the curve just eased its way into the final setpoint, like we have seen in so many other states."

![Adjustment to final setpoint](MN_adjustment.png)

"Now, the adjustment to that final setpoint was really a herculean effort by our vote counters. We were able to report 289157 votes in 17 seconds. This reduced the percentage from 83% to 77% Trump to Biden votes, because Biden received the lion's share of that valiant effort."

![194,846 vote reduction](MN_reduction.png)

"So - that number - 194846 - is kinda like the other reductions we have seen in other states. If you take that number and divide it by the total on the line above, it is usually apparent that is it a calculated reduction. If we do that here 194846/2071091 = 9.41% reduction. I would have expected it to be 9.5% of 10%...a nice round reduction like seen in other states. So, I looked as what we have going on. If we look at the reduction in just Trump's votes, what we have on this line is a reduction coupled with a flip from the 3rd party. If we remove the flip from the 3rd party, we get a reduction of 87049.15 votes from Trump's tally, which is a 4.20% reduction in Trump's overall vote at that time."

![Cleanup reductions](MN_finish_up.png)

"Annnddd - we finish up, much like the other states. We have our percentage control of the interval hanging tight - while we find places for the reductions to happen, without changing either the interval percentage distribution or the overall percentage ratio. These cleanup reductions are in between the reports that take about 10 minutes for each single vote to be counted. I guess they were tired from the big push earlier."

***

Does reviewing this data make you look at our election process differently?

I know when I first saw this data about nine months ago I was unsettled—I hadn't considered this possibility. But with this new information I went forth with new questions. (See chapter 10 for a brief history of voting machines.)

Remember that the Backup Attack phase is used when the initial attack doesn't go as planned. The biggest tool is the injection of votes electronically. If this can be done without detection, a race can still be won regardless of how many physical ballots were delivered absentee (dropbox or mail-in) or at the in-person polling place on election day and subsequently scanned through tabulators.

There is a theory out there which Draza's data begins to provide evidence for that the 2020 election was less an election and more a simulation disguised as an election. (This is in part why I made the acronym for the title of this book = SIM.) We don't *need* that perspective to lay out the anomalies, indicators, and evidence, but it does serve to provide a working explanation for the irregularities reported around the state and in the Edison Research data.

Once the simulation concept is understood, lower level manipulation can occur in the databases or voting machines in counties and precincts to achieve results at that lower level which align with the top-down algorithms.












After I've written this book, do you think Dominion, ES&S, or Hart will (s)elect me in the primary? If I somehow get through the primary, how about the general?

One of the best ways to understand the set point phenomenon and the shuffle is through Draza Smith's Rhode Island analysis. According to Erin Clements, "that's the only only place where we have apples to apples comparison between what we were told was happening on election night and what's actually stored inside the computer system." Note that these two sets of data cannot be reconciled.

The reason we are starting with Rhode Island is because the state is smaller than many counties in other states *and* provides a cast vote record (CVR) for the entire state, which is very useful.




## Reported Results

For the purposes of discussion, consider that in 2020 there were actually two elections, 1) the single-day in-person election at your precinct polling place on November 3, 2020, and 2) the 46-day absentee/mail-in voting election from September 18 to November 2, 2020.

The MN State Canvassing Board reported 1,380,333 votes cast in person—it could be said that only 42% of Minnesotans participated on election day itself. As for the second election, up from 24% in the prior election absentee or mail-in ballots represented 58% (1,906,383 votes) of a record 3,292,997 total votes. Many more Minnesotans participated in this 46-day absentee/mail-in voting election.

Minnesota <a href="https://www.sos.state.mn.us/about-the-office/news-room/state-canvassing-board-certifies-results-of-2020-general-election/" target=_new>led the country</a> for the third election in a row with nearly 80% voter turnout (the highest percentage turnout since 1956). Remember that this number includes phantom voters that should not be on voter rolls to begin with (as shown in door-to-door canvassing efforts in 30 counties). Very high voter turnout (above 60%) is a reliable indicator of potential fraud.

Next, let's take a look at how votes were reported to the media (refer back to Russ Ramsland's slide above for reference). The following graphic shows how the votes were sent through to the media from Edison Research. Notice the <strong>negative 194,846 votes</strong> near interval 50.

<a href="https://t.me/ladydraza/511" target=_new>Draza Smith's view</a> is that each state is given a target "set point", so named because the shape of these graphs resembles a <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Utkal-Mehta/publication/49848870/figure/fig3/AS:574107383066624@1513889274474/a-Setpoint-input-Process-output-by-b-proposed-method-c-Visioli-et-als-method_Q640.jpg" target=_new>controlled industrial system</a>.

But there were set point changes on election night after Florida with its 29 electoral college votes went for Trump. Why? A presidential candidate needs 270 electoral college votes to win. So, if Florida was meant to go to Biden in the original plan, now that it had gone to Trump the other states' set points would need to be changed in order to achieve an overall Biden win. Those 29 electoral college votes would need to be found elsewhere.
</p>
<br>

<p>
To emphasize the point these illustrations are making: It is likely the entire country's election were managed top-down. When it became clear that a lot of Republican voters were showing up in person on election day, the algorithm had to be reset. Only then could the desired result be achieved. But then, once it had been announced that Biden won, the work was far from over for the election cartel: now they would have to ensure that ballots were delivered across the country where the people were most likely to ask questions. Unfortunately for the cartel, citizens of every state and probably in every county of every state are working hard to decipher exactly what happened. The truth simply cannot be hidden forever so long as enough people remain focused on discovering it.
</p><p>
Another way of approaching the problem is through <a href="https://captk.com/" target=_new>Seth Keshel's trend analysis</a> from 2008-2020, which accounts for registration changes and population growth. His Minnesota analysis concluded there may have been around 228,000 excess Democrat votes in 2020. Keep in mind, this trend analysis is built up off of very likely manipulated elections in 2008, 2012, and 2016. Apparently, Biden's official (unofficial) vote total in 2020 was 1,717,077 (45.28%) versus Trump's 1,484,065 votes (52.40%). That's a sizeable 7.12% margin, which in my opinion is one of the tactics to get Minnesotans not to even look into whether their elections were free and fair or not while the fake news repeated 'no widespread fraud' and 'not enough fraud to change the election.' Is the media still singing this tune or have their deceptive tactics changed once more?
</p><p>
Based on the data currently available, it looks like Trump carried Minnesota, probably comfortably—that is the magnitude of the impact the combination of machines and mass mail-in ballots and inflated voter roles can have. They can swing actual vote counts by 10% or more if needed. But remember, this isn't only about Biden and Trump. The machines are capable of manipulating votes up and down the ballot, from president to schoolboard director. Is it any wonder then that most school boards aren't working for the benefit of children, but instead doing the opposite?

<br>
<p>
In phone conversations I had with Minnesota election officials in summer 2021 and in more recent discussions that I've observed, so far none have *said* they've lost faith in the electronic voting equipment. Again, what was shown in the <a href="https://magaraccoon.com/docs/MesaCountyReport3.pdf" target=_new>Mesa County Report #3</a>, where an unauthorized creation of new election databases occurred during early voting in October 2020, was that in that case the election officials could not have been responsible for the changes. From this perspective, it's very possible that many election officials are hostages in a bad system. Will any of these election officials, recorders, or clerks come to our aid once they realize the people simply want the truth about election results? After all, isn't it their statutory duty to preserve election materials and records for 22 months after a general election?
</p><p>
Now, supposing you wanted to verify the output of the machine process with the results reported by precints, counties, or the secretary of state's website—how could you do that? One way would be to examine the cast vote record (CVR) reports, which are automatically generated by the tabulators as ballots are scanned in. However, to date, despite the clarity of <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/13" target=_new>CHAPTER 13, GOVERMENT DATA PRACTICES</a>, no CVRs have been shared with any Minnesotan requesting them, although one county attorney has said in writing that they do not have them, which either shows 1) a lack of understanding of how the machines work, 2) a lack of understanding of election record retention laws, or 3) potentially an understanding that if shared the CVR provides the public a way to check the accuracy of reported election results.
</p><p>
You could also do a full and complete audit of ballots, tabulators, and election management systems for a county or even for a precinct. A partial audit was done in Maricopa County, Arizona and men and women in Otero County, New Mexico are currently conducting an audit of their county's 2020 General Election. Kansas may have an audit soon as well.
</p><p>
Part of the Maricopa County audit scope of work which was not completed by the official audit was the door-to-door canvassing. This is a method to compare the voter rolls and histories with the responses given by those men and women themselves. It is eye-opening when the voter histories shows a person did not vote but they claim they did. This approach also is effective in confirming phantom voters in the voter rolls. In Minnesota, the results of this method (using sites like <a href="https://canvassmn.com" target=_new>https://canvassmn.com</a> were brought to the Crow Wing County commissioners board meeting and was influential in persuading them to <a href="https://erikvanmechelen.substack.com/p/motion-passed-to-request-minnesota" target=_new>pass a resolution</a> in favor of asking the Minnesota Secretary of State to help them to unseal their ballots and conduct an audit. (The request was declined.)

<small>Postelection reviews reveal missing ballots</small>
<p>
<a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/206.89" target=_new>Minnesota Statute 206.89 POSTELECTION REVIEW OF VOTING SYSTEMS</a> hand counts ballots returned by the optical scan ballot counters in select precincts, known as a <a href="https://www.sos.state.mn.us/elections-voting/how-elections-work/post-election-reviews/" target=_new>postelection review</a>. (These are sometimes referred to as risk-limiting audits.)
</p><p>
In a postelection review in Dakota County's Precinct 4950, WEST ST PAUL W-2 P-2, the total unadjusted difference was 870 votes. 7 of those 870 votes were explained, but 863 were not explained. Why then does the total adjusted difference (the last column) show all zeros? The total adjusted difference should read 863 (870 minus 7). Even with 65% (863 out of 1327) of the total votes in this postelection review left unexplained, the Final Results row says this is a "Difference of not more than 0.5%" and the Total Adjusted Difference is "0%", deemed "ACCEPTABLE".
</p>
<br>
<img src="/precinct4950.png" alt="Precinct 4950: Total Unadjusted Difference = 870">
<br>
<p>
Of course, this is clearly <strong>not</strong> acceptable and it begs the question: How many more precincts would turn up red flags like this if more postelection reviews had been done? And how many more red flags might be raised if proper audits were done? With this work being shown to Minnesotans, it would be strange if they were not asking for audits and  accountability.
</p>
<small>A petition to stop the certification of Minnesota's Election</small>
<p>
Based on the postelection review above (but not only that) it was correct for <a href="https://shogrensmithlaw.com/about-us" target=_new>Susan Shogren Smith</a> to properly serve <a href="https://erikvanmechelen.substack.com/p/should-minnesotas-2020-election-have" target=_new>a petition</a> to each member of the Minnesota State Canvassing Board prior to its certification of the 2020 election, in part reading: "Minnesota candidates for office and voters have come forward with affadavits detailing concerns and observations about the ignored and failed election processes in counties across the state...If this Court does not take action to prevent the certification of the Minnesota election until a complete, bi-partisan statewide audit of the election occurs, including election materials, our election system, and the trust of the voters, will be irreparably harmed."
</p><p>
The MN State Canvassing Board is the sole entity identified in the MN Constitution carrying the duty to canvass the statewide election results. However, the MN Supreme Court erroneously ruled (in my opinion) that all 87 counties had to be served. Therefore <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20420161-order-minnesota-supreme-court-dismisses-gop-election-contest" target=_new>the case was dismissed</a> without a hearing on the facts on Friday afternoon, December 4, 2020. This dismissal was critical to meeting the the safe harbor deadline of December 8, 2020.
</p><p>
Since that time, every point made in the petition has been confirmed by the work of Rick Weible and others, including "issues related to procedure, observer and election judge access, voter intimidation, lost ballots, lost absentee envelopes, missing election materials and questionable ballots... [and] concerns about voting equipment transmitting results during the early counting period on election day."
</p><p>
With a lack of transparency and demonstrated gaps in the election process across the country and in Minnesota, many have asked, Where are the consequences? We could shrug our shoulders and say, What can we really do? We could sit back and see if the situation improves on its own. We could even give up.
</p><p>
Or we can decide to put the truth on the table, brick by brick, so that before long every Minnesotan knows the truth—all except those that choose the temporary comforts of willful ignorance. Once enough people see what's wrong, available remedies will be welcomed.
