Let's keep hammering the EAC... Did you know they oversaw the distribution of $400 Million from the CARES ACT.

Yea the same EAC who:

-signed a financial conflict of interest waiver allowing companies like Dominion handle the "physical security, cyber security, and emergency preparedness of the nationâ€™s election infrastructure"

-certified and accredited Dominion VS

ALSO OVERSAW THE DISTRIBUTION OF $400 m of our tax dollars...

How did some of these states spend that?
