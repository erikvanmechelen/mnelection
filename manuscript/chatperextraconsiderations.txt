Let's keep hammering the EAC... Did you know they oversaw the distribution of $400 Million from the CARES ACT.

Yea the same EAC who:

-signed a financial conflict of interest waiver allowing companies like Dominion handle the "physical security, cyber security, and emergency preparedness of the nation’s election infrastructure"

-certified and accredited Dominion VS

ALSO OVERSAW THE DISTRIBUTION OF $400 m of our tax dollars...

How did some of these states spend that?

Dan Wolbert's point, that it could have been thrown out. 
One citizen, who has also recently active in alerting the Dakota County Sheriff's Department to the backstory $17 billion
