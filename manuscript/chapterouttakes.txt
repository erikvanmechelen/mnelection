The Backup Attack phase is used when the initial attack doesn't go as planned. The biggest tool is the injection of votes electronically. If this can be done without detection, a race can still be won regardless of how many physical ballots were delivered absentee (dropbox or mail-in) or at the in-person polling place on election day and subsequently scanned through tabulators.

There is a theory out there that the 2020 election was less an election and more a simulation disguised as an election. (This is in part why I made the acronym for the title of this book is SIM.) We don't *need* that perspective to lay out the anomalies, indicators, and evidence, but it does serve to provide a working explanation for the irregularities reported around the state and in the Edison Research data.

Once the simulation concept is understood, lower level manipulation can occur in the databases or voting machines in counties and precincts to achieve results at that lower level which align with the top-down algorithms.

***

One of the best ways to understand the set point phenomenon and the shuffle is through Draza Smith's Rhode Island analysis. According to Erin Clements, "that's the only only place where we have apples to apples comparison between what we were told was happening on election night and what's actually stored inside the computer system." Note that these two sets of data cannot be reconciled.

The reason we are starting with Rhode Island is because the state is smaller than many counties in other states *and* provides a cast vote record (CVR) for the entire state, which is very useful.




## Reported Results

For the purposes of discussion, consider that in 2020 there were actually two elections, 1) the single-day in-person election at your precinct polling place on November 3, 2020, and 2) the 46-day absentee/mail-in voting election from September 18 to November 2, 2020.

The MN State Canvassing Board reported 1,380,333 votes cast in person—it could be said that only 42% of Minnesotans participated on election day itself. As for the second election, up from 24% in the prior election absentee or mail-in ballots represented 58% (1,906,383 votes) of a record 3,292,997 total votes. Many more Minnesotans participated in this 46-day absentee/mail-in voting election.

Minnesota <a href="https://www.sos.state.mn.us/about-the-office/news-room/state-canvassing-board-certifies-results-of-2020-general-election/" target=_new>led the country</a> for the third election in a row with nearly 80% voter turnout (the highest percentage turnout since 1956). Remember that this number includes phantom voters that should not be on voter rolls to begin with (as shown in door-to-door canvassing efforts in 30 counties). Very high voter turnout (above 60%) is a reliable indicator of potential fraud.

Next, let's take a look at how votes were reported to the media (refer back to Russ Ramsland's slide above for reference). The following graphic shows how the votes were sent through to the media from Edison Research. Notice the <strong>negative 194,846 votes</strong> near interval 50. In a system that is aggregating votes, should there ever be a drop in nearly 200,000 votes? What may have caused that?

<a href="https://t.me/ladydraza/511" target=_new>Draza Smith's view</a> is that each state is given a target "set point", so named because the shape of these graphs resembles a <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Utkal-Mehta/publication/49848870/figure/fig3/AS:574107383066624@1513889274474/a-Setpoint-input-Process-output-by-b-proposed-method-c-Visioli-et-als-method_Q640.jpg" target=_new>controlled industrial system</a>.

But there were set point changes on election night after Florida with its 29 electoral college votes went for Trump. Why? A presidential candidate needs 270 electoral college votes to win. So, if Florida was meant to go to Biden in the original plan, now that it had gone to Trump the other states' set points would need to be changed in order to achieve an overall Biden win. Those 29 electoral college votes would need to be found elsewhere.
</p>
<br>

<br>
<p>
To emphasize the point these illustrations are making: It is likely the entire country's election were managed top-down. When it became clear that a lot of Republican voters were showing up in person on election day, the algorithm had to be reset. Only then could the desired result be achieved. But then, once it had been announced that Biden won, the work was far from over for the election cartel: now they would have to ensure that ballots were delivered across the country where the people were most likely to ask questions. Unfortunately for the cartel, citizens of every state and probably in every county of every state are working hard to decipher exactly what happened. The truth simply cannot be hidden forever so long as enough people remain focused on discovering it.
</p><p>
Another way of approaching the problem is through <a href="https://captk.com/" target=_new>Seth Keshel's trend analysis</a> from 2008-2020, which accounts for registration changes and population growth. His Minnesota analysis concluded there may have been around 228,000 excess Democrat votes in 2020. Keep in mind, this trend analysis is built up off of very likely manipulated elections in 2008, 2012, and 2016. Apparently, Biden's official (unofficial) vote total in 2020 was 1,717,077 (45.28%) versus Trump's 1,484,065 votes (52.40%). That's a sizeable 7.12% margin, which in my opinion is one of the tactics to get Minnesotans not to even look into whether their elections were free and fair or not while the fake news repeated 'no widespread fraud' and 'not enough fraud to change the election.' Is the media still singing this tune or have their deceptive tactics changed once more?
</p><p>
Based on the data currently available, it looks like Trump carried Minnesota, probably comfortably—that is the magnitude of the impact the combination of machines and mass mail-in ballots and inflated voter roles can have. They can swing actual vote counts by 10% or more if needed. But remember, this isn't only about Biden and Trump. The machines are capable of manipulating votes up and down the ballot, from president to schoolboard director. Is it any wonder then that most school boards aren't working for the benefit of children, but instead doing the opposite?

MORE COVER UP

Minnesota uses Dominion, ES&S, and Hart systems, although <a href="https://erikvanmechelen.substack.com/p/only-6-out-of-87-counties-in-minnesota" target=_new>only 6 of 87 counties have election machines certified by the EAC</a>, which may conflict with <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/206.57" target=_new>Minnesota Statute 206.57 Subd. 6. Required Certification</a>, which reads in part "...a voting system must be certified by an independent testing authority accredited by the Election Assistance Commission..."
</p>

<br>
<p>
In phone conversations I had with Minnesota election officials in summer 2021 and in more recent discussions that I've observed, so far none have *said* they've lost faith in the electronic voting equipment. Again, what was shown in the <a href="https://magaraccoon.com/docs/MesaCountyReport3.pdf" target=_new>Mesa County Report #3</a>, where an unauthorized creation of new election databases occurred during early voting in October 2020, was that in that case the election officials could not have been responsible for the changes. From this perspective, it's very possible that many election officials are hostages in a bad system. Will any of these election officials, recorders, or clerks come to our aid once they realize the people simply want the truth about election results? After all, isn't it their statutory duty to preserve election materials and records for 22 months after a general election?
</p><p>
Now, supposing you wanted to verify the output of the machine process with the results reported by precints, counties, or the secretary of state's website—how could you do that? One way would be to examine the cast vote record (CVR) reports, which are automatically generated by the tabulators as ballots are scanned in. However, to date, despite the clarity of <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/13" target=_new>CHAPTER 13, GOVERMENT DATA PRACTICES</a>, no CVRs have been shared with any Minnesotan requesting them, although one county attorney has said in writing that they do not have them, which either shows 1) a lack of understanding of how the machines work, 2) a lack of understanding of election record retention laws, or 3) potentially an understanding that if shared the CVR provides the public a way to check the accuracy of reported election results.
</p><p>
You could also do a full and complete audit of ballots, tabulators, and election management systems for a county or even for a precinct. A partial audit was done in Maricopa County, Arizona and men and women in Otero County, New Mexico are currently conducting an audit of their county's 2020 General Election. Kansas may have an audit soon as well.
</p><p>
Part of the Maricopa County audit scope of work which was not completed by the official audit was the door-to-door canvassing. This is a method to compare the voter rolls and histories with the responses given by those men and women themselves. It is eye-opening when the voter histories shows a person did not vote but they claim they did. This approach also is effective in confirming phantom voters in the voter rolls. In Minnesota, the results of this method (using sites like <a href="https://canvassmn.com" target=_new>https://canvassmn.com</a> were brought to the Crow Wing County commissioners board meeting and was influential in persuading them to <a href="https://erikvanmechelen.substack.com/p/motion-passed-to-request-minnesota" target=_new>pass a resolution</a> in favor of asking the Minnesota Secretary of State to help them to unseal their ballots and conduct an audit. (The request was declined.)

<small>Postelection reviews reveal missing ballots</small>
<p>
<a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/206.89" target=_new>Minnesota Statute 206.89 POSTELECTION REVIEW OF VOTING SYSTEMS</a> hand counts ballots returned by the optical scan ballot counters in select precincts, known as a <a href="https://www.sos.state.mn.us/elections-voting/how-elections-work/post-election-reviews/" target=_new>postelection review</a>. (These are sometimes referred to as risk-limiting audits.)
</p><p>
In a postelection review in Dakota County's Precinct 4950, WEST ST PAUL W-2 P-2, the total unadjusted difference was 870 votes. 7 of those 870 votes were explained, but 863 were not explained. Why then does the total adjusted difference (the last column) show all zeros? The total adjusted difference should read 863 (870 minus 7). Even with 65% (863 out of 1327) of the total votes in this postelection review left unexplained, the Final Results row says this is a "Difference of not more than 0.5%" and the Total Adjusted Difference is "0%", deemed "ACCEPTABLE".
</p>
<br>
<img src="/precinct4950.png" alt="Precinct 4950: Total Unadjusted Difference = 870">
<br>
<p>
Of course, this is clearly <strong>not</strong> acceptable and it begs the question: How many more precincts would turn up red flags like this if more postelection reviews had been done? And how many more red flags might be raised if proper audits were done? With this work being shown to Minnesotans, it would be strange if they were not asking for audits and  accountability.
</p>
<small>A petition to stop the certification of Minnesota's Election</small>
<p>
Based on the postelection review above (but not only that) it was correct for <a href="https://shogrensmithlaw.com/about-us" target=_new>Susan Shogren Smith</a> to properly serve <a href="https://erikvanmechelen.substack.com/p/should-minnesotas-2020-election-have" target=_new>a petition</a> to each member of the Minnesota State Canvassing Board prior to its certification of the 2020 election, in part reading: "Minnesota candidates for office and voters have come forward with affadavits detailing concerns and observations about the ignored and failed election processes in counties across the state...If this Court does not take action to prevent the certification of the Minnesota election until a complete, bi-partisan statewide audit of the election occurs, including election materials, our election system, and the trust of the voters, will be irreparably harmed."
</p><p>
The MN State Canvassing Board is the sole entity identified in the MN Constitution carrying the duty to canvass the statewide election results. However, the MN Supreme Court erroneously ruled (in my opinion) that all 87 counties had to be served. Therefore <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20420161-order-minnesota-supreme-court-dismisses-gop-election-contest" target=_new>the case was dismissed</a> without a hearing on the facts on Friday afternoon, December 4, 2020. This dismissal was critical to meeting the the safe harbor deadline of December 8, 2020.
</p><p>
Since that time, every point made in the petition has been confirmed by the work of Rick Weible and others, including "issues related to procedure, observer and election judge access, voter intimidation, lost ballots, lost absentee envelopes, missing election materials and questionable ballots... [and] concerns about voting equipment transmitting results during the early counting period on election day."
</p><p>
With a lack of transparency and demonstrated gaps in the election process across the country and in Minnesota, many have asked, Where are the consequences? We could shrug our shoulders and say, What can we really do? We could sit back and see if the situation improves on its own. We could even give up.
</p><p>
Or we can decide to put the truth on the table, brick by brick, so that before long every Minnesotan knows the truth—all except those that choose the temporary comforts of willful ignorance. Once enough people see what's wrong, available remedies will be welcomed.

MOVED BELOW TO PREP
DS200s were used in more than 60 of Minnesota's 87 counties in 2020.

In April 2021, the DS200 used in Antrim, County Michigan was found to have a [4G wireless modem installed](https://letsfixstufforg-my.sharepoint.com/personal/patrick_letsfixstuff_org/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fpatrick%5Fletsfixstuff%5Forg%2FDocuments%2FFiles%2F2020%20Election%2FLegal%2FExhibit%206%20Jim%20Penrose%20Report%2Epdf&parent=%2Fpersonal%2Fpatrick%5Fletsfixstuff%5Forg%2FDocuments%2FFiles%2F2020%20Election%2FLegal&ga=1) within the enclosure of the machine.

![Telit LE910-SV1 found within ES&S enclosure](telit.png)

Furthermore, [the exhibit describes](https://letsfixstufforg-my.sharepoint.com/personal/patrick_letsfixstuff_org/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fpatrick%5Fletsfixstuff%5Forg%2FDocuments%2FFiles%2F2020%20Election%2FLegal%2FExhibit%206%20Jim%20Penrose%20Report%2Epdf&parent=%2Fpersonal%2Fpatrick%5Fletsfixstuff%5Forg%2FDocuments%2FFiles%2F2020%20Election%2FLegal&ga=1) how the card was "utilizing a commercial Verizon SIM card with an APN configuration specific to the ES&S DS200 provisioning. Testing revealed that the same SIM card could be utilized in a separate wireless hotspot device and the device could then join the same APN as the ES&S voting machines. An unauthorized user could gain access to this APN by an extra SIM card pre-provisioned for this APN, or by removing a SIM from an operational device and using it in another device."

To repeat: This wireless modem was found on an enclosed part of the machine. Therefore if these same or similar wireless modems were also installed on the DS200s throughout Minnesota, it would be invisible to election judges, poll challengers, and even election officials.

Are you concerned that contracts with our hardware and software vendors makes it very difficult to inspect the machines or source code? Does it worry you that Minnesota Statutes make it difficult to have this done? 18 months after November 3rd, 2020, don't you think it would have been prudent to have settled the conspiracy theories by showing the public that the machines are clean?

Neither the chair of a major political party nor the secretary of state asked for a third party to inspect the source code of the machines, which [Minnesota Statute 206.57 Subd.6](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/206.57) allows for.

Furthermore, according to [Patrick Colbeck](https://letsfixstuff.org/2022/05/beware-of-just-count-the-ballots-narrative/), "only a full forensic audit of the entire election record chain of custody can determine whether or not an election was conducted with integrity."

Even with the "defense phase" (cover up and destruction of evidence) of the election coup falling apart, so far no county commissions have decided to return to hand counting paper ballots as many of their constituents desire—instead, counties plan to run elections on very similar if not the same software which managed the 2020 election. This would be unwise if fair and transparent elections are desired. The people should continue going to their county commissioner board meetings to inform them of available fixes to restore trust to all voters.

Shah's campaign asked for audits, no answer from the party.

all this is part of election process

who wins primary becomes the party candidate, and republican candidate or democrat candidate usually win, since most voters have been funneled (through decades of influence operations) into supporting the candidate that their party puts forward.

In the recent past, as the Democrat party has moved further to the left ideologically. Part of the uniparty strategy seems to be to endorse and run Republican candidates that are fairly weak and unexciting, like for example ["Low-Energy Jeb"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXKmEEAhDj0). This way, low propensity republican voters will stay home in greater numbers opening the door to the Attack Phase where mail-in ballots are submitted for them.

(If I can be afforded to have a bit of fun: Low-Energy Jeb was so low energy that I once contributed to a [USA Today article](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/05/28/jeb-bush-terry-mcauliffe-invest-workers-spur-economic-recovery-column/5259291002/) he co-authored with then Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, recently defeated by Governor Glenn Youngkin. Youngkin's victory was supposedly a win for Republicans, but in my opinion Youngkin could be a Republican in disguise (RID) and a suitable poster child for the false assertion that in machine-driven elections the algorithms can be easily overwhelmed. We are seeing in multiple 2022 primaries that the algorithms are doing quite well at selecting candidates.)

## Endorsements

this could also happen in the minnesota primary on august 9 for select races

I think I understand your frustration with Wardlow apparently going back on his word.

In my opinion Wardlow should not have agreed to honor the endorsement: However if he had said that, likely that admission would have been used against him as well.

How *should* he have played it?

Maybe he could have learned from how Trump answered when asked in his debate vs. Biden.

Trump said if the election is fair, I’ll accept it, but if there’s fraud, I won’t.

Instead of giving a Yes/No answer which can be used against him.

Jesus, when asked if taxes should be paid to Ceasar:

Give unto Ceasar what is Ceaser’s, give unto God what is God’s.

Neil Shah asked for audits of the Rochester state convention results, which David Haan explicitly said would be available to any campaign after the convention. No response from MNGOP.

I don’t have a good feeling at all about how MNGOP ran state convention.

Am writing a bit about this in the short free book that will be ready in coming weeks.

Some description of what these do...


To date, no counties in Minnesota have been able to produce a cast vote record (CVR) report from their tabulators, which is the machine tally generated as paper ballots are fed into it.

Also to date, no independent audit of the machines has been done of any Minnesota county. This would be welcome not only because the people of Crow Wing County persuaded their county commissioners to ask the Minnesota Secretary of State for a proper audit, but also since according to Dr. Douglas Frank the ES&S DS200s are among the most vulnerable voting machines in the country and a [4G wireless modem was found in Antrim's DS200](https://letsfixstufforg-my.sharepoint.com/personal/patrick_letsfixstuff_org/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fpatrick%5Fletsfixstuff%5Forg%2FDocuments%2FFiles%2F2020%20Election%2FLegal%2FExhibit%206%20Jim%20Penrose%20Report%2Epdf&parent=%2Fpersonal%2Fpatrick%5Fletsfixstuff%5Forg%2FDocuments%2FFiles%2F2020%20Election%2FLegal&ga=1).

Are you concerned that contracts with our hardware and software vendors makes it very difficult to inspect the machines or source code? Does it worry you that Minnesota Statutes make it difficult to have this done? 18 months after November 3rd, 2020, don't you think it would have been prudent to have settled the conspiracy theories by showing the public that the machines are clean?

Neither the chair of a major political party nor the secretary of state asked for a third party to inspect the source code of the machines, which [Minnesota Statute 206.57 Subd.6](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/206.57) allows for.

Furthermore, according to [Patrick Colbeck](https://letsfixstuff.org/2022/05/beware-of-just-count-the-ballots-narrative/), "only a full forensic audit of the entire election record chain of custody can determine whether or not an election was conducted with integrity."

Even with the "defense phase" (cover up and destruction of evidence) of the election coup falling apart, so far no county commissions (in Minnesota) have decided to return to hand counting paper ballots as many of their constituents desire—instead, counties plan to run elections on very similar if not the same software which managed the 2020 election. This would be unwise if fair and transparent elections are desired. The people should continue going to their county commissioner board meetings to inform them of available fixes to restore trust to all voters.

A petition to stop the certification of Minnesota's Election

Based on the postelection review above (but not only that) it was correct for [Susan Shogren Smith](https://shogrensmithlaw.com/about-us) to properly [serve a petition](https://erikvanmechelen.substack.com/p/should-minnesotas-2020-election-have) to each member of the Minnesota State Canvassing Board prior to its certification of the 2020 election, in part reading: "Minnesota candidates for office and voters have come forward with affadavits detailing concerns and observations about the ignored and failed election processes in counties across the state...If this Court does not take action to prevent the certification of the Minnesota election until a complete, bi-partisan statewide audit of the election occurs, including election materials, our election system, and the trust of the voters, will be irreparably harmed."

The MN State Canvassing Board is the sole entity identified in the MN Constitution carrying the duty to canvass the statewide election results. However, the MN Supreme Court erroneously ruled (in my opinion) that all 87 counties had to be served. Therefore the case was dismissed without a hearing on the facts on Friday afternoon, December 4, 2020. This dismissal was critical to meeting the the safe harbor deadline of December 8, 2020.

Since that time, every point made in the petition has been confirmed by the work of Rick Weible and others, including "issues related to procedure, observer and election judge access, voter intimidation, lost ballots, lost absentee envelopes, missing election materials and questionable ballots... [and] concerns about voting equipment transmitting results during the early counting period on election day."

With a lack of transparency and demonstrated gaps in the election process across the country and in Minnesota, many have asked, Where are the consequences? We could shrug our shoulders and say, What can we really do? We could sit back and see if the situation improves on its own. We could even give up.

Or we can decide to put the truth on the table, brick by brick, so that before long every Minnesotan knows the truth—all except those that choose the temporary comforts of willful ignorance. Once enough people see what's wrong, available remedies will be welcomed.

Robin Sylvestre, canvass Results

Robin Sylvester, [May 18, 2022 at 8:08:54 PM]:
I gave Jeremy the details today.

We’ve  lead a foot canvass in crow wing county last fall and about 4% of the households who took the survey with phantom votes-  voters who said they didn’t vote in the 2020 election and about 7% of the households who completed the survey who had lost votes.  This included their vote wasn’t recorded or it was switched from in person to absentee.

Good luck and have fun!





## Todd County CVRs

put image here...

then i learned it was possible to configure DS200s to act like Model 100s (a previous version of the tabulator) which does not include a CVR.

why buy the new versions and then use the *old* configurations? who made this decision?



BELOw here PASTED IN PREPARATION

##A History
In the first place, how did we get to using machines, and *electronic* voting machines, in elections?

Before voting machines, voting was often done by voice throughout the 1800s. Kentucky used voice voting until 1891. The first paper ballots arrive in the early 19th century.

Then came voting machines: first lever, then punch cards.

Lever voting machines have been around a long time.

![Drawing of Voting Machine](1votingmachine.jpg)

Here’s a physical example:

![Lever Voting Machine](2votingmachine.jpg)

Punch card systems were developed in the 1960s and were last used in two Idaho counties in 2014, on [the Votomatic](https://verifiedvoting.org/election-system/ess-votomatic/) provided by ES&S.

![Punch Card System](3votingmachine.jpg)

Fast forward to the 2000 presidential election between Al Gore and George W. Bush. Hanging chads on Sequoia Voting Systems punch-card voting system led to a recount, which Bush won.

![Hanging Chads](4votingmachine.jpg)

Sequoia Voting Systems got its start in the 1970s as Mathematical Systems Corporation of Anaheim, California, offering an alternative to ES&S’s Votomatic punch cards. On March 8, 2005 Smartmatic Corp. (a Venezuelan company) acquired Sequoia. This raised eyebrows since Smartmatic had only the previous year been selected to by the Chavez-era Venezuelan government to provide voting systems for the presidential recall election, it’s [first time providing machines](https://ia801704.us.archive.org/34/items/smartmatic-sequoia-and-venezuela/Smartmatic%20Sequoia%20and%20Venezuela.pdf) for an election. As of June 4, 2010 it’s parent company was Dominion Voting Systems.

According to Sequoia’s own employees, Sequoia may have [been responsible](https://web.archive.org/web/20070928013625/http://www.votetrustusa.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2560&Itemid=51) for the defective punch cards in Florida which led to “hanging chads” or undervotes to the tune of 10,000 in Palm Beach County.

One of Sequoia’s workers [told](https://web.archive.org/web/20070928013625/http://www.votetrustusa.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2560&Itemid=51) Dan Rather:

“My own personal opinion was the touch screen voting system wasn't getting off the ground like that they—like they would hope. And because they weren't having any problems with paper ballots. So, I feel like they—deliberately did all this to have problems with the paper ballots so the electronically voting systems would get off the ground—and which it did in a big way.”

Specifically, USC 52 Ch. 209 Subchapter I—PAYMENTS TO STATES FOR ELECTION ADMINISTRATION IMPROVEMENTS AND REPLACEMENT OF PUNCH CARD AND LEVER VOTING MACHINES. §20902 states: Replacement of punch card or lever voting machines.

Sequoia benefitted from the passage of federal legislation in 2002—[the Help America Vote Act of 2002](https://www.justice.gov/crt/help-america-vote-act-2002)—because *they manufactured electronic voting equipment*.

In 2003 Beverly Harris found Diebold’s source code on the internet. Diebold had only entered the elections business a year prior through its purchase of Global Elections Systems, a touch-screen voting technology producer in Texas. The source code revealed that Diebold voting systems used an unsecured access database, meaning anyone could access, change data, and erase logs.

In 2007 Diebold Election Systems rebranded as Premier Election Solutions and in 2009 they sold to Election Systems & Software (ES&S), which by 2014 was the largest manufacturer of United States voting machines.

The [Source Code Review of the Diebold Voting System](https://jhalderm.com/pub/papers/diebold-ttbr07.pdf) was published by 6 authors on July 20, 2007, showed the system was 1) vulnerable to malicious software, 2) susceptible to viruses, 3) failed to protect ballot secrecy, and 4) vulnerable to malicious insiders.

More recently, one of the authors of the Diebold review, J. Alex Halderman of Princeton University, provided [the Halderman Declaration](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21038844-20210802-expert-rebuttal-declaration-of-j-alex-halderman) on Georgia’s ballot marking devices (BMD). Halderman has also issued a sealed [25,000-word report](https://libertysword.com/expert-hackers-25000-word-secret-report-threatens-to-uncover-georgias-real-election) on voting systems vulnerabilities.

In an emergency meeting in Otero County, New Mexico in May 2022, nation-state vulnerability expert Jeff Lensberg further detailed vulnerabilities.

##Putting the History in Context

The history of voting machines spans over 100 years. However the use of electronic voting machines is very short, only two to three decades. During almost the entirety of that duration, the electronic systems have been shown to be insecure, hackable, and manipulable, sometimes if not often by design.

Their lack of certifications is further troubling.

Col. Shawn Smith, in the Tarrant County, TX meeting in the first half of 2022:

“…And for the people who said well, the machines are certified, I would say, the space shuttle Columbia was also certified for flight. How’d that turn out? The Boeing 737 Max was certified for passenger operations, and then crashed killing over 500 people in two separate accidents before they finally let experts take a look at it. And my point in saying that is not to try to scare people, but just to say that based on my experience, and I’m not a cyber professional, but I work with cyber pros, and I know the difference between somebody who knows cyber and somebody who doesn’t. And if you don’t know the difference, then you’re in very dangerous territory when you try to make any conclusions or try to listen to someone who doesn’t really know what they’re talking about.

“Our voting systems from my perspective based on the expert examiner’s report, cannot be trusted with our election. And what they require in order to for you to verify for yourself is that you become a cyber expert. Otherwise, you’re forced to trust other people who say they’re experts, people who have conflicts of interest, and people who’ve been trained essentially by the National Association of Secretaries of State, the election directors, and the Election Assistance Commission…”

###Certifications Are Less Than Useless

Throughout its [certification process](https://www.eac.gov/voting-equipment/system-certification-process), the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) which was established by [the Help America Vote Act](https://www.eac.gov/about_the_eac/help_america_vote_act.aspx) (2002) has not certified about 95% of Minnesota counties.

Those county’s electronic voting equipment are merely certified by the Minnesota Secretary of State. The few counties that are EAC certified have the problem indicated by Col. Shawn Smith, that those certifications provide the illusion of security when in fact those systems are anything but ready to run secure elections.

Let's take a look at the certification maps. Note that being certified or not certified doesn’t guarantee system security, as we shall discuss shortly.

In the following image, Red = Certified | White = Not Certified

![USA EAC Certification Map](cert_map1.png)

If we zoom in on Minnesota, we find that only 6 of 87 counties have voting equipment that is certified by the EAC. Remember, red counties are certified, white are not certified.

![MN EAC Certification Map](certmap2.png)

Here are the counties in Minnesota that are certified by the EAC:

![County EAC Certifications](certmap3.png)

Thinking that this felt off, I called the EAC and left a voicemail and sent a question by email, which was replied to the same day (04/20/2022).

![EAC email reply](certmap4.png)

This may have been comforting if not for a close reading of Minnesota election law.

[Minnesota Statute 206.57, Subd.6](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/206.57) states in full:

Subd. 6.Required certification.

In addition to the requirements in subdivision 1, a voting system must be certified by an independent testing authority accredited by the Election Assistance Commission or appropriate federal agency responsible for testing and certification of compliance with the federal voting systems guidelines at the time of submission of the application required by subdivision 1 to be in conformity with voluntary voting system guidelines issued by the Election Assistance Commission or other previously referenced agency. The application must be accompanied by the certification report of the voting systems test laboratory. A certification under this section from an independent testing authority accredited by the Election Assistance Commission or other previously referenced agency meets the requirement of Minnesota Rules, part [8220.0350](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/rules/8220.0350/), item L. A vendor must provide a copy of the source code for the voting system to the secretary of state. A chair of a major political party or the secretary of state may select, in consultation with the vendor, an independent third-party evaluator to examine the source code to ensure that it functions as represented by the vendor and that the code is free from defects. A major political party that elects to have the source code examined must pay for the examination. Except as provided by this subdivision, a source code that is trade secret information must be treated as nonpublic information, according to [section 13.37](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/13.37). A third-party evaluator must not disclose the source code to anyone else.

It is important to note that as of now there are no other appropriate federal agencies outside of the Election Assistance Commission (EAC), which itself authorizes Pro V&V and SLI Compliance.

Are There Limits to Certifications from the EAC?

Let’s take a look at the [EAC certification for Dominion 4.14-E](https://www.dropbox.com/s/b0efp9zqshzj1cm/EAC%20Report_DVS4.14E_FinalCert_FINAL_7.2.15.pdf?dl=0).

![EAC Certification for Dominion 4.14-E](certmap5.png)

On [page 1](https://www.dropbox.com/s/b0efp9zqshzj1cm/EAC%20Report_DVS4.14E_FinalCert_FINAL_7.2.15.pdf?dl=0) note the last sentence:

“This certificate is not an endorsement of the product by any agency of the U.S. Government and no warranty of the product is either expressed or implied.”

On page 2 it reads:

![Page 2 of EAC Certification for Dominion 4.14-E](certmap6.png)

Note the second to last bullet point in “Significant of EAC Certification”:
“An EAC certification is **not**: A determination that the system is ready for use in an election.”

Then what might these certifications be for?

Are they meant to give the public a false sense of security?

Finally, compare the full [14-page EAC certification](https://www.dropbox.com/s/b0efp9zqshzj1cm/EAC%20Report_DVS4.14E_FinalCert_FINAL_7.2.15.pdf?dl=0) to the State of Minnesota Secretary of State Certification of Dominion Democracy Suite Version 4.14-E Voting System reproduced below:

![Page 1 of the State of Minnesota Secretary of State Certification of Dominion Democracy Suite Version 4.14-E Voting System](certmap7.png)

And page 2 of the same:

![Page 2 of the State of Minnesota Secretary of State Certification of Dominion Democracy Suite Version 4.14-E Voting System](certmap8.png)

What did you notice?

It reads very similarly, sometimes verbatim, to the EAC’s certifications, which the EAC admits do not indicate a voting machine is ready for use in an election.

### Digging Deeper (into Known Vulnerabilities)

Should the public have questions when 81 out of 87 counties in Minnesota DO NOT have certified election equipment according to the Election Assistance Commission, which under [Minnesota Statute 206.57 Subd.6](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/206.57) those election machines should have prior to use?

Are there consequences to certifications (the EAC certifications) which have disclaimers putting the value of the certification itself into question?

What *should* these certifications imply in a more common-sense world?

In the [3/15/2022 Nye County, Nevada County Commissioner’s meeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=234&v=GBKz1o_VqAE&feature=youtu.be) cyber security consultant Mark Cook [described his experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKz1o_VqAE&t=234s) with computers pre-internet in the CompuServe and Prodigy days, then as a consultant to protect companies from threats and seal off vulnerability, and finally with election systems.

Today, Dominion is a popular voting system which uses Microsoft SQL database, one which Mark was and is very familiar with as he used SQL databases from day 1. In the same meeting, he discussed how within the first minute of getting his hands on a Dominion system, he was able to access the backend and change votes without leaving a trace.

As has now been shown, certifications (and the lack of certifications) have not protected the right of men and women to vote freely and fairly in this country. For just one example, the [Mesa County Colorado Voting Systems Report #3: Election Database and Data Process Analysis](https://magaraccoon.com/docs/MesaCountyReport3.pdf) proves database manipulation happened inside the Colorado Dominion Voting Systems (DVS) Election Management System (EMS). Not once, but twice, in both the 2020 General Election and the 2021 Grand Junction Municipal Election.

Fortunately, there are signs around the country that people are becoming aware of the fundamental issue (that these machines are designed to allow manipulation) and using their voice to affect change how their county conducts elections. Yesterday, April 19, 2022, men and women spoke in Crow Wing, Dakota, and Sherburne counties ([video from Sherburne](https://erikvanmechelen.substack.com/p/open-forum-speakers-address-removing)). Recently, two counties in Nevada, Nye and Esmeralda have already decided not to use electronic voting equipment in upcoming elections. Which county commissioners will be the first in Minnesota to do the same and restore the voice that is constitutionally inherent in the right to vote to their constituents?

##Summary

The certifications are less than meaningless.

The machines are insecure and have been from the beginning.

It may not surprise you that Sequoia, which was integral to the country pivoting to electronic voting equipment through creating the hanging chad debacle, is still involved in the elections business. Sequoia was sold to Smartmatic and their current parent company is Dominion Voting Systems.

Why do our county commissioners and election officials continue to feel confident in these systems? Why are more and more people showing up to county commissioner meetings to share what they've learned? Is it possible to return to hand tallying paper ballots?

EDIT
Next, let's begin a step by step journey following a vote through our entire election system. How a vote travels will illuminate the many flaws in our complex system.

Minnesota No. 1 in Voter ~~Turnout~~ Fraud

EDIT: remove sensationalism and sentimentality

I should have taken the September 2020 Project Veritas video about the Ilhan Omar-connected ballot harvesting scheme in Minneapolis as a sign to pay closer attention to the upcoming election. Fortunately mistakes can be learned from and put in a context which produces awareness for proper future action. Even to the point that minor mistakes are welcomed as a reality test and recalibration. But even though I went to bed early on 3 November, around 9:30 p.m., having read that the absentee ballots by the books would not need to be fully counted in battleground states on election night, when I awoke on 4 November I was nevertheless unsettled by what I came to understand happened in the early morning hours. But I didn’t have much time to dig in as we were paying a visit to my wife’s childhood friend’s family in State College, Pennsylvania the next day.

There, we were treated by our hosts to hours of uninterrupted and uncensored CNN coverage (as in 1984 the TV loomed ever-present in the background) detailing for instance Biden’s remarkable comeback turning a midnight Pennsylvania deficit of 555,189 votes into a tighter race. Attention everyone, let’s keep counting absentee ballots as long as it takes! On Saturday 7 November at 11:25 a.m. the Associated Press called the state for Biden—what gives any media outlet the authority to ‘call’ a race?—holding a 34,243 vote lead (by 15 December that was extended to a 81,660 vote margin). We were driving to the trailhead of the Thousand Steps on Jacks Mountain when my wife’s friend saw this notification and excitedly shared the news, which enlivened the mood for others in the car. I hiked peacefully enough as it really was a beautiful and sunny autumn day, however even a dip in a cold lake that afternoon could not lower my temperature enough to prevent my pent up anger spilling out that evening in an argument about whether skin color mattered relative to so many other dimensions of a human. I did not back down from but nor did I love my enemy that night. It made for an awkward breakfast the next morning where it was suggested that I might have done better to model my approach to conversation after the people of Japan, who my host had concluded on his trip there prioritize respect and politeness. The substance of the argument we had, though, has yet to be taken up. Moms and dads across the country have since made it clear in school board meetings that they understand critical race theory itself to be racist and therefore an inappropriate ideology to be peddled in publicly funded schools. At this point in my anecdote, however, I bet you haven’t failed to notice what else wasn’t said. By me.

For some reason I wasn’t ready to speak up about the election.

Meanwhile, the mainstream media was not giving up on the coverup.

Trump's lawsuits. No standing. The President of the United States had no standing. Therefore evidence wasn't shown because the vast majority of these cases didn't reach the evidentiary stage.

Early on, the media seemed to ignore election fraud news, but in February The Times went a different route. An article on the shadow campaign that saved the election included this already infamous sentence: “That’s why the participants want the secret history of the 2020 election told, even though it sounds like a paranoid fever dream—a well-funded cabal of powerful people, ranging across industries and ideologies, working together behind the scenes to influence perceptions, change rules and laws, steer media coverage and control the flow of information. They were not rigging the election; they were fortifying it.”

The fact that this article was written and published is one of many bizarre events I've noted in recent months. What these sentences describe is quite close to what happened.

Because to some extent the well funded cabal has succeeded in controlling the flow of information, the truth—including significant election-changing evidence—has taken time and effort to emerge.






Why did it take me so long to arrive in a place where I had developed the internal constitution to honestly investigate issues for myself? Why only then was I determined to think as clearly as possible while also tuning into my intuition on vital issues?

In early 2021 A friend of mine said I should watch a video interivew between Robert David Steele and Martin Geddes. This introduced me to the Q posts and got me onto Telegram.

By summer, although still working on client books, I was getting restless. A number of influencers on Telegram had said things would be cleaned up soon and Trump would be reinserted. As dates came and went, I decided I had to do something.

First I tried to go to work for Project Veritas. When that didn't work out, I found an online group on Telegram whose stated mission was to produce audits in Minnesota.

Early on, I volunteered to help moderate the chat room. Soon after, I was asked to be the lead for communications. There was also a lead for freedom of information act (FOIA) requests, documents, and research. At first there was one admin, who oversaw everything and was the liason to the national leaders. Later, she was removed and two admins were put in place. I didn't speak with any of the national leaders until a few days before I decided to leave this group about 45 days after I joined it.

Several of the relationships formed in this mostly anonymous group were maintained and became valuable.

Still, though, I didn't go to a presentation until October 2021. (Brought camera... )

Furthermore, [the exhibit describes](https://letsfixstufforg-my.sharepoint.com/personal/patrick_letsfixstuff_org/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fpatrick%5Fletsfixstuff%5Forg%2FDocuments%2FFiles%2F2020%20Election%2FLegal%2FExhibit%206%20Jim%20Penrose%20Report%2Epdf&parent=%2Fpersonal%2Fpatrick%5Fletsfixstuff%5Forg%2FDocuments%2FFiles%2F2020%20Election%2FLegal&ga=1) how the card was "utilizing a commercial Verizon SIM card with an APN configuration specific to the ES&S DS200 provisioning. Testing revealed that the same SIM card could be utilized in a separate wireless hotspot device and the device could then join the same APN as the ES&S voting machines. An unauthorized user could gain access to this APN by an extra SIM card pre-provisioned for this APN, or by removing a SIM from an operational device and using it in another device."

To repeat: This wireless modem was found on an enclosed part of the machine. Therefore if these same or similar wireless modems were also installed on the DS200s throughout Minnesota, it would be invisible to election judges, poll challengers, and even election officials.

Are you concerned that contracts with our hardware and software vendors makes it very difficult to inspect the machines or source code? Does it worry you that Minnesota Statutes make it difficult to have this done? 19 months after November 3rd, 2020, don't you think it would have been prudent to have settled the conspiracy theories by showing the public that the machines are clean?

Neither the chair of a major political party nor the secretary of state asked for a third party to inspect the source code of the machines, which [Minnesota Statute 206.57 Subd.6](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/206.57) allows for.

Furthermore, according to [Patrick Colbeck](https://letsfixstuff.org/2022/05/beware-of-just-count-the-ballots-narrative/), "only a full forensic audit of the entire election record chain of custody can determine whether or not an election was conducted with integrity."

Even with the defense phase (cover up and destruction of evidence) of the election coup falling apart, so far no county commissions (in Minnesota) have decided to return to hand counting paper ballots as many of their constituents desire—instead, counties plan to run elections on very similar if not the same software which managed the 2020 election. This would be unwise if fair and transparent elections are desired.

I fully support the many people continuing to go to their county commissioner board meetings to inform them of available fixes to restore trust to all voters.

(Anecdote about why I sent a data request to Todd County...




## Summary from Jeffrey O'Donnell

The following post from Jeffrey O'Donnell, aka 'The Lone Raccoon' on Telegram, describes how the enemy's defense has been weakened:

"I joined this fight full time more than nine months ago. I wilfully pushed the pause button on our lives and trusted God to provide - and he has. I have a new appreciation for the Israelites who were given manna to survive - each day's needs are supplied. The next week or month... that's where faith and trust come in. At that time, Lindell's symposium had just happened and everyone thought the pcap information would save us. We were wrong. Specifically speaking,

* the process of defining the algorithms used to sway the election was still in its infancy, with Ed Solomon and Draza Smith only just starting to be able to describe the process

* State voter rolls were being only cursorily examined, and little comparison was being done between states

* The inner workings of the election servers was still a complete mystery

* Most analysis of the 2020 fraud was being done by people within counties. Very little information was being shared between states or even counties

* The clues to the whole thing in the Edison election night reporting were seen but not yet understood

* No effort existed to collect, analyze, and share election data such as cast vote records and ballot images. The importance of Cast Vote Records in this fight was really not recognized yet.

* Although "phantom" absentee votes were suspected, their prevalence and widespread abuse was not generally known yet.

* Protecting 2022/2024, while on people's radar, had no viable plan."

The Lone Raccoon goes on to contrast that August 2021 position with the June 2022 position:

"Now look at today.

* the algorithm used by the election servers is well understood and can even be predicted now
* Tremendous problems with voter rolls have been loudly documented in many states.
* We have a full understanding of the internal working of the Dominion system, with other vendors soon to come.
* There is coordination and cooperation - and healthy competition - between groups in different states
* Edison has been revealed to be a conspirator in the election plot, and while much is still not understood, the "edison zero" and the flipping of votes between absentee and in-person has been well-documented, as has the fact that the reporting is largely theater and does not match up well with the actual results in a state/county until the very end,
* Cast Vote Records, ballot images, tabulator logs, voter rolls/histories and more have been obtained from many counties in many states, and their analysis has proved crucial. Any bit of data we get from a county is something they cannot destroy in September.
* Massive absentee ballot fraud is a fact.
* Findings from 2020 are being used in many ways to minimize the fraud potential in future elections... plus the identification of any fraud now takes minutes rather than months.
* Serious court cases (much better than the quick ones done right after the election) are progressing in numerous states"

Where are the arrests? Please do not be naïve. We are forced to be a citizen's Justice Department, because our country does not currently have a functioning one. Our burden of proof is immense and unfair. We have no subpeona or warrant power. You need to think of this for what it is - a national RICO case. Read how Guliani broke up the mobs in New York. He built his case from the ground up and quietly climbed the ladder of corruption until he had the goods on ALL the bosses. Then he struck."







OUTTAKES... or CONSIDERATIONS ... ?




QUOTED FROM OPENING OF THIS CHAPTER


-summary point - chair calls paper ballot, saboteurs
-summary point - electronic voting devices, lol
-...
-was there vote shaving w/ Padgett? (Munson quote from Jamie?)
-kim/kelly no endorsement in my opinion OR kelly was asked to step aside and did so
-endorsements run on electronic voting equipment with no transparent verification (COMPARE David Haan's emails prior with what they did/didn't do at convention... and Neil Shah asks for audits, receives no response)
-calls for unity... but chair does not model this behavior... instead trying to silence free speech lol

-my story so far...
-given incorrect info by my own bpou chair:
-...no money
-...stiff competition
-...cd8 says to mark, don't have me on
-...diana friemann, olmsted gop pushback
-all this to be expected because secretary of state is a crucial role for establishment to own - look at the behavior of secretaries of state across the nation - how many seem to care about the election coup? how many have demonstrated through decisive actions how they care about it? (see New Mexico... provide links to David Clements' work, incestuous, etc.)
-part of reason you must share this free book
-because the information must get to those who are curious to know, to those who weren't at precinct, bpou, and state conventions, but who as citizens have a right to know





quote from kelly, or

quote from isabel?

Isabelle,
from Ecuador
communism, mom and dad lost everything
she wanted to speak about the machines
it possibly was "out of order"
so she was asked to stop speaking
she went back to her seat, clearly distraught
i went a few sections over to her, looking for her make america great again hat
found her, crying
i said she did the right thing
to speak the truth
then she told me
people here don't understand
what don't they understand?
what's going to happen
tells me story of mom and dad


Will be critical and ask questions.

helped get legislators to cyber symposium
even got meeting with Eric Mortensen with Dr. Douglas Frank
apparently ball was in Frank's court and didn't follow up with Mortensen
unfortunate because when I spoke with Mortensen about it in late April, 2022, at the CD3 convention (I was there doing recon, hoping to speak with Kim and Kelly as I weighed the decision to run for secretary of state)
Mortensen seemed to still have a bad taste in his mouth about it
but the reality was there were great presenations and info shared
like this one (parable of the traffickers, which has been shown to be correct in spirit through the work of True the Vote's Katherine Engelbrecht and Gregg Phillips, showcased in 2000 mules )
or this talk from phil waldron, etc.
or this one looking at the before / after image (Tina Peters) now subject of
the [S]election Code (selectioncode.com) docuementary.
so
it is too bad that in my opinion we haven't heard much from these folks
i donated to lucero at the launch of the child protection Something (that michelle lentz invited me to)
and told him i was at the cyber symposium
because he only vaguely recalled speaking with me there
where he seemed a bit nervous that I was a writer
"I still don't work for anyone" i said,
i said thank you for keeping election integrity in mind
but he didn't share more about his plans there
and this legislative session was sorely lacking
^
do i need to be this critical, only if they actually haven't said anything.

the truth is the commissioners need spine, that can help

but need constituents
need legislators
need judges
need executive branch

all have to have spine, principles, courage

Because without access to information, how can the public make informed decisions? How can you give informed consent? How can you live in the truth if you aren't aware of it?

project veritas, focus on somali community
bigger story is 2000 mules
videographer tells me they are trying to connect to culture
pull stories often after they've done much work on them
fundraising emails and letters:
we want to cover election fraud, but we need more money
where are the stories about election machines?
(robert barnes - desantis doesn't have an election fraud problem)

put all the stories from CD5 show

clay county
michelle benson's son
Paul "Hold the Line" Gazelka
Eric "Dems stopped all our election integrity bills" Lucero
Glenn "I wrote the voter id bill" Gruenhagen
^
look for press releases about the cyber symposium.


to add, edwin's cease and desist letter to david haan?


or, put conversation in body... and find another quote for up here...

quote from kelly at convention?

no i didn't, but i'm sure it's good...

really?
