The Backup Attack phase is used when the initial attack doesn't go as planned. The biggest tool is the injection of votes electronically. If this can be done without detection, a race can still be won regardless of how many physical ballots were delivered absentee (dropbox or mail-in) or at the in-person polling place on election day and subsequently scanned through tabulators.

There is a theory out there that the 2020 election was less an election and more a simulation disguised as an election. (This is in part why I made the acronym for the title of this book is SIM.) We don't *need* that perspective to lay out the anomalies, indicators, and evidence, but it does serve to provide a working explanation for the irregularities reported around the state and in the Edison Research data.

Once the simulation concept is understood, lower level manipulation can occur in the databases or voting machines in counties and precincts to achieve results at that lower level which align with the top-down algorithms.

***

One of the best ways to understand the set point phenomenon and the shuffle is through Draza Smith's Rhode Island analysis. According to Erin Clements, "that's the only only place where we have apples to apples comparison between what we were told was happening on election night and what's actually stored inside the computer system." Note that these two sets of data cannot be reconciled.

The reason we are starting with Rhode Island is because the state is smaller than many counties in other states *and* provides a cast vote record (CVR) for the entire state, which is very useful.




## Reported Results

For the purposes of discussion, consider that in 2020 there were actually two elections, 1) the single-day in-person election at your precinct polling place on November 3, 2020, and 2) the 46-day absentee/mail-in voting election from September 18 to November 2, 2020.

The MN State Canvassing Board reported 1,380,333 votes cast in person—it could be said that only 42% of Minnesotans participated on election day itself. As for the second election, up from 24% in the prior election absentee or mail-in ballots represented 58% (1,906,383 votes) of a record 3,292,997 total votes. Many more Minnesotans participated in this 46-day absentee/mail-in voting election.

Minnesota <a href="https://www.sos.state.mn.us/about-the-office/news-room/state-canvassing-board-certifies-results-of-2020-general-election/" target=_new>led the country</a> for the third election in a row with nearly 80% voter turnout (the highest percentage turnout since 1956). Remember that this number includes phantom voters that should not be on voter rolls to begin with (as shown in door-to-door canvassing efforts in 30 counties). Very high voter turnout (above 60%) is a reliable indicator of potential fraud.

Next, let's take a look at how votes were reported to the media (refer back to Russ Ramsland's slide above for reference). The following graphic shows how the votes were sent through to the media from Edison Research. Notice the <strong>negative 194,846 votes</strong> near interval 50. In a system that is aggregating votes, should there ever be a drop in nearly 200,000 votes? What may have caused that?

<a href="https://t.me/ladydraza/511" target=_new>Draza Smith's view</a> is that each state is given a target "set point", so named because the shape of these graphs resembles a <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Utkal-Mehta/publication/49848870/figure/fig3/AS:574107383066624@1513889274474/a-Setpoint-input-Process-output-by-b-proposed-method-c-Visioli-et-als-method_Q640.jpg" target=_new>controlled industrial system</a>.

But there were set point changes on election night after Florida with its 29 electoral college votes went for Trump. Why? A presidential candidate needs 270 electoral college votes to win. So, if Florida was meant to go to Biden in the original plan, now that it had gone to Trump the other states' set points would need to be changed in order to achieve an overall Biden win. Those 29 electoral college votes would need to be found elsewhere.
</p>
<br>

<br>
<p>
To emphasize the point these illustrations are making: It is likely the entire country's election were managed top-down. When it became clear that a lot of Republican voters were showing up in person on election day, the algorithm had to be reset. Only then could the desired result be achieved. But then, once it had been announced that Biden won, the work was far from over for the election cartel: now they would have to ensure that ballots were delivered across the country where the people were most likely to ask questions. Unfortunately for the cartel, citizens of every state and probably in every county of every state are working hard to decipher exactly what happened. The truth simply cannot be hidden forever so long as enough people remain focused on discovering it.
</p><p>
Another way of approaching the problem is through <a href="https://captk.com/" target=_new>Seth Keshel's trend analysis</a> from 2008-2020, which accounts for registration changes and population growth. His Minnesota analysis concluded there may have been around 228,000 excess Democrat votes in 2020. Keep in mind, this trend analysis is built up off of very likely manipulated elections in 2008, 2012, and 2016. Apparently, Biden's official (unofficial) vote total in 2020 was 1,717,077 (45.28%) versus Trump's 1,484,065 votes (52.40%). That's a sizeable 7.12% margin, which in my opinion is one of the tactics to get Minnesotans not to even look into whether their elections were free and fair or not while the fake news repeated 'no widespread fraud' and 'not enough fraud to change the election.' Is the media still singing this tune or have their deceptive tactics changed once more?
</p><p>
Based on the data currently available, it looks like Trump carried Minnesota, probably comfortably—that is the magnitude of the impact the combination of machines and mass mail-in ballots and inflated voter roles can have. They can swing actual vote counts by 10% or more if needed. But remember, this isn't only about Biden and Trump. The machines are capable of manipulating votes up and down the ballot, from president to schoolboard director. Is it any wonder then that most school boards aren't working for the benefit of children, but instead doing the opposite?

MORE COVER UP

Minnesota uses Dominion, ES&S, and Hart systems, although <a href="https://erikvanmechelen.substack.com/p/only-6-out-of-87-counties-in-minnesota" target=_new>only 6 of 87 counties have election machines certified by the EAC</a>, which may conflict with <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/206.57" target=_new>Minnesota Statute 206.57 Subd. 6. Required Certification</a>, which reads in part "...a voting system must be certified by an independent testing authority accredited by the Election Assistance Commission..."
</p>

<br>
<p>
In phone conversations I had with Minnesota election officials in summer 2021 and in more recent discussions that I've observed, so far none have *said* they've lost faith in the electronic voting equipment. Again, what was shown in the <a href="https://magaraccoon.com/docs/MesaCountyReport3.pdf" target=_new>Mesa County Report #3</a>, where an unauthorized creation of new election databases occurred during early voting in October 2020, was that in that case the election officials could not have been responsible for the changes. From this perspective, it's very possible that many election officials are hostages in a bad system. Will any of these election officials, recorders, or clerks come to our aid once they realize the people simply want the truth about election results? After all, isn't it their statutory duty to preserve election materials and records for 22 months after a general election?
</p><p>
Now, supposing you wanted to verify the output of the machine process with the results reported by precints, counties, or the secretary of state's website—how could you do that? One way would be to examine the cast vote record (CVR) reports, which are automatically generated by the tabulators as ballots are scanned in. However, to date, despite the clarity of <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/13" target=_new>CHAPTER 13, GOVERMENT DATA PRACTICES</a>, no CVRs have been shared with any Minnesotan requesting them, although one county attorney has said in writing that they do not have them, which either shows 1) a lack of understanding of how the machines work, 2) a lack of understanding of election record retention laws, or 3) potentially an understanding that if shared the CVR provides the public a way to check the accuracy of reported election results.
</p><p>
You could also do a full and complete audit of ballots, tabulators, and election management systems for a county or even for a precinct. A partial audit was done in Maricopa County, Arizona and men and women in Otero County, New Mexico are currently conducting an audit of their county's 2020 General Election. Kansas may have an audit soon as well.
</p><p>
Part of the Maricopa County audit scope of work which was not completed by the official audit was the door-to-door canvassing. This is a method to compare the voter rolls and histories with the responses given by those men and women themselves. It is eye-opening when the voter histories shows a person did not vote but they claim they did. This approach also is effective in confirming phantom voters in the voter rolls. In Minnesota, the results of this method (using sites like <a href="https://canvassmn.com" target=_new>https://canvassmn.com</a> were brought to the Crow Wing County commissioners board meeting and was influential in persuading them to <a href="https://erikvanmechelen.substack.com/p/motion-passed-to-request-minnesota" target=_new>pass a resolution</a> in favor of asking the Minnesota Secretary of State to help them to unseal their ballots and conduct an audit. (The request was declined.)

<small>Postelection reviews reveal missing ballots</small>
<p>
<a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/206.89" target=_new>Minnesota Statute 206.89 POSTELECTION REVIEW OF VOTING SYSTEMS</a> hand counts ballots returned by the optical scan ballot counters in select precincts, known as a <a href="https://www.sos.state.mn.us/elections-voting/how-elections-work/post-election-reviews/" target=_new>postelection review</a>. (These are sometimes referred to as risk-limiting audits.)
</p><p>
In a postelection review in Dakota County's Precinct 4950, WEST ST PAUL W-2 P-2, the total unadjusted difference was 870 votes. 7 of those 870 votes were explained, but 863 were not explained. Why then does the total adjusted difference (the last column) show all zeros? The total adjusted difference should read 863 (870 minus 7). Even with 65% (863 out of 1327) of the total votes in this postelection review left unexplained, the Final Results row says this is a "Difference of not more than 0.5%" and the Total Adjusted Difference is "0%", deemed "ACCEPTABLE".
</p>
<br>
<img src="/precinct4950.png" alt="Precinct 4950: Total Unadjusted Difference = 870">
<br>
<p>
Of course, this is clearly <strong>not</strong> acceptable and it begs the question: How many more precincts would turn up red flags like this if more postelection reviews had been done? And how many more red flags might be raised if proper audits were done? With this work being shown to Minnesotans, it would be strange if they were not asking for audits and  accountability.
</p>
<small>A petition to stop the certification of Minnesota's Election</small>
<p>
Based on the postelection review above (but not only that) it was correct for <a href="https://shogrensmithlaw.com/about-us" target=_new>Susan Shogren Smith</a> to properly serve <a href="https://erikvanmechelen.substack.com/p/should-minnesotas-2020-election-have" target=_new>a petition</a> to each member of the Minnesota State Canvassing Board prior to its certification of the 2020 election, in part reading: "Minnesota candidates for office and voters have come forward with affadavits detailing concerns and observations about the ignored and failed election processes in counties across the state...If this Court does not take action to prevent the certification of the Minnesota election until a complete, bi-partisan statewide audit of the election occurs, including election materials, our election system, and the trust of the voters, will be irreparably harmed."
</p><p>
The MN State Canvassing Board is the sole entity identified in the MN Constitution carrying the duty to canvass the statewide election results. However, the MN Supreme Court erroneously ruled (in my opinion) that all 87 counties had to be served. Therefore <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20420161-order-minnesota-supreme-court-dismisses-gop-election-contest" target=_new>the case was dismissed</a> without a hearing on the facts on Friday afternoon, December 4, 2020. This dismissal was critical to meeting the the safe harbor deadline of December 8, 2020.
</p><p>
Since that time, every point made in the petition has been confirmed by the work of Rick Weible and others, including "issues related to procedure, observer and election judge access, voter intimidation, lost ballots, lost absentee envelopes, missing election materials and questionable ballots... [and] concerns about voting equipment transmitting results during the early counting period on election day."
</p><p>
With a lack of transparency and demonstrated gaps in the election process across the country and in Minnesota, many have asked, Where are the consequences? We could shrug our shoulders and say, What can we really do? We could sit back and see if the situation improves on its own. We could even give up.
</p><p>
Or we can decide to put the truth on the table, brick by brick, so that before long every Minnesotan knows the truth—all except those that choose the temporary comforts of willful ignorance. Once enough people see what's wrong, available remedies will be welcomed.

MOVED BELOW TO PREP
DS200s were used in more than 60 of Minnesota's 87 counties in 2020.

In April 2021, the DS200 used in Antrim, County Michigan was found to have a [4G wireless modem installed](https://letsfixstufforg-my.sharepoint.com/personal/patrick_letsfixstuff_org/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fpatrick%5Fletsfixstuff%5Forg%2FDocuments%2FFiles%2F2020%20Election%2FLegal%2FExhibit%206%20Jim%20Penrose%20Report%2Epdf&parent=%2Fpersonal%2Fpatrick%5Fletsfixstuff%5Forg%2FDocuments%2FFiles%2F2020%20Election%2FLegal&ga=1) within the enclosure of the machine.

![Telit LE910-SV1 found within ES&S enclosure](telit.png)

Furthermore, [the exhibit describes](https://letsfixstufforg-my.sharepoint.com/personal/patrick_letsfixstuff_org/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fpatrick%5Fletsfixstuff%5Forg%2FDocuments%2FFiles%2F2020%20Election%2FLegal%2FExhibit%206%20Jim%20Penrose%20Report%2Epdf&parent=%2Fpersonal%2Fpatrick%5Fletsfixstuff%5Forg%2FDocuments%2FFiles%2F2020%20Election%2FLegal&ga=1) how the card was "utilizing a commercial Verizon SIM card with an APN configuration specific to the ES&S DS200 provisioning. Testing revealed that the same SIM card could be utilized in a separate wireless hotspot device and the device could then join the same APN as the ES&S voting machines. An unauthorized user could gain access to this APN by an extra SIM card pre-provisioned for this APN, or by removing a SIM from an operational device and using it in another device."

To repeat: This wireless modem was found on an enclosed part of the machine. Therefore if these same or similar wireless modems were also installed on the DS200s throughout Minnesota, it would be invisible to election judges, poll challengers, and even election officials.

Are you concerned that contracts with our hardware and software vendors makes it very difficult to inspect the machines or source code? Does it worry you that Minnesota Statutes make it difficult to have this done? 18 months after November 3rd, 2020, don't you think it would have been prudent to have settled the conspiracy theories by showing the public that the machines are clean?

Neither the chair of a major political party nor the secretary of state asked for a third party to inspect the source code of the machines, which [Minnesota Statute 206.57 Subd.6](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/206.57) allows for.

Furthermore, according to [Patrick Colbeck](https://letsfixstuff.org/2022/05/beware-of-just-count-the-ballots-narrative/), "only a full forensic audit of the entire election record chain of custody can determine whether or not an election was conducted with integrity."

Even with the "defense phase" (cover up and destruction of evidence) of the election coup falling apart, so far no county commissions have decided to return to hand counting paper ballots as many of their constituents desire—instead, counties plan to run elections on very similar if not the same software which managed the 2020 election. This would be unwise if fair and transparent elections are desired. The people should continue going to their county commissioner board meetings to inform them of available fixes to restore trust to all voters.

Shah's campaign asked for audits, no answer from the party.

all this is part of election process

who wins primary becomes the party candidate, and republican candidate or democrat candidate usually win, since most voters have been funneled (through decades of influence operations) into supporting the candidate that their party puts forward.

In the recent past, as the Democrat party has moved further to the left ideologically. Part of the uniparty strategy seems to be to endorse and run Republican candidates that are fairly weak and unexciting, like for example ["Low-Energy Jeb"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXKmEEAhDj0). This way, low propensity republican voters will stay home in greater numbers opening the door to the Attack Phase where mail-in ballots are submitted for them.

(If I can be afforded to have a bit of fun: Low-Energy Jeb was so low energy that I once contributed to a [USA Today article](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/05/28/jeb-bush-terry-mcauliffe-invest-workers-spur-economic-recovery-column/5259291002/) he co-authored with then Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, recently defeated by Governor Glenn Youngkin. Youngkin's victory was supposedly a win for Republicans, but in my opinion Youngkin could be a Republican in disguise (RID) and a suitable poster child for the false assertion that in machine-driven elections the algorithms can be easily overwhelmed. We are seeing in multiple 2022 primaries that the algorithms are doing quite well at selecting candidates.)

## Endorsements

this could also happen in the minnesota primary on august 9 for select races

I think I understand your frustration with Wardlow apparently going back on his word.

In my opinion Wardlow should not have agreed to honor the endorsement: However if he had said that, likely that admission would have been used against him as well.

How *should* he have played it?

Maybe he could have learned from how Trump answered when asked in his debate vs. Biden.

Trump said if the election is fair, I’ll accept it, but if there’s fraud, I won’t.

Instead of giving a Yes/No answer which can be used against him.

Jesus, when asked if taxes should be paid to Ceasar:

Give unto Ceasar what is Ceaser’s, give unto God what is God’s.

Neil Shah asked for audits of the Rochester state convention results, which David Haan explicitly said would be available to any campaign after the convention. No response from MNGOP.

I don’t have a good feeling at all about how MNGOP ran state convention.

Am writing a bit about this in the short free book that will be ready in coming weeks.

Some description of what these do...


To date, no counties in Minnesota have been able to produce a cast vote record (CVR) report from their tabulators, which is the machine tally generated as paper ballots are fed into it.

Also to date, no independent audit of the machines has been done of any Minnesota county. This would be welcome not only because the people of Crow Wing County persuaded their county commissioners to ask the Minnesota Secretary of State for a proper audit, but also since according to Dr. Douglas Frank the ES&S DS200s are among the most vulnerable voting machines in the country and a [4G wireless modem was found in Antrim's DS200](https://letsfixstufforg-my.sharepoint.com/personal/patrick_letsfixstuff_org/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fpatrick%5Fletsfixstuff%5Forg%2FDocuments%2FFiles%2F2020%20Election%2FLegal%2FExhibit%206%20Jim%20Penrose%20Report%2Epdf&parent=%2Fpersonal%2Fpatrick%5Fletsfixstuff%5Forg%2FDocuments%2FFiles%2F2020%20Election%2FLegal&ga=1).

Are you concerned that contracts with our hardware and software vendors makes it very difficult to inspect the machines or source code? Does it worry you that Minnesota Statutes make it difficult to have this done? 18 months after November 3rd, 2020, don't you think it would have been prudent to have settled the conspiracy theories by showing the public that the machines are clean?

Neither the chair of a major political party nor the secretary of state asked for a third party to inspect the source code of the machines, which [Minnesota Statute 206.57 Subd.6](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/206.57) allows for.

Furthermore, according to [Patrick Colbeck](https://letsfixstuff.org/2022/05/beware-of-just-count-the-ballots-narrative/), "only a full forensic audit of the entire election record chain of custody can determine whether or not an election was conducted with integrity."

Even with the "defense phase" (cover up and destruction of evidence) of the election coup falling apart, so far no county commissions (in Minnesota) have decided to return to hand counting paper ballots as many of their constituents desire—instead, counties plan to run elections on very similar if not the same software which managed the 2020 election. This would be unwise if fair and transparent elections are desired. The people should continue going to their county commissioner board meetings to inform them of available fixes to restore trust to all voters.

A petition to stop the certification of Minnesota's Election

Based on the postelection review above (but not only that) it was correct for [Susan Shogren Smith](https://shogrensmithlaw.com/about-us) to properly [serve a petition](https://erikvanmechelen.substack.com/p/should-minnesotas-2020-election-have) to each member of the Minnesota State Canvassing Board prior to its certification of the 2020 election, in part reading: "Minnesota candidates for office and voters have come forward with affadavits detailing concerns and observations about the ignored and failed election processes in counties across the state...If this Court does not take action to prevent the certification of the Minnesota election until a complete, bi-partisan statewide audit of the election occurs, including election materials, our election system, and the trust of the voters, will be irreparably harmed."

The MN State Canvassing Board is the sole entity identified in the MN Constitution carrying the duty to canvass the statewide election results. However, the MN Supreme Court erroneously ruled (in my opinion) that all 87 counties had to be served. Therefore the case was dismissed without a hearing on the facts on Friday afternoon, December 4, 2020. This dismissal was critical to meeting the the safe harbor deadline of December 8, 2020.

Since that time, every point made in the petition has been confirmed by the work of Rick Weible and others, including "issues related to procedure, observer and election judge access, voter intimidation, lost ballots, lost absentee envelopes, missing election materials and questionable ballots... [and] concerns about voting equipment transmitting results during the early counting period on election day."

With a lack of transparency and demonstrated gaps in the election process across the country and in Minnesota, many have asked, Where are the consequences? We could shrug our shoulders and say, What can we really do? We could sit back and see if the situation improves on its own. We could even give up.

Or we can decide to put the truth on the table, brick by brick, so that before long every Minnesotan knows the truth—all except those that choose the temporary comforts of willful ignorance. Once enough people see what's wrong, available remedies will be welcomed.

Robin Sylvestre, canvass Results

Robin Sylvester, [May 18, 2022 at 8:08:54 PM]:
I gave Jeremy the details today.

We’ve  lead a foot canvass in crow wing county last fall and about 4% of the households who took the survey with phantom votes-  voters who said they didn’t vote in the 2020 election and about 7% of the households who completed the survey who had lost votes.  This included their vote wasn’t recorded or it was switched from in person to absentee.

Good luck and have fun!





## Todd County CVRs

put image here...

then i learned it was possible to configure DS200s to act like Model 100s (a previous version of the tabulator) which does not include a CVR.

why buy the new versions and then use the *old* configurations? who made this decision?



BELOw here PASTED IN PREPARATION

##A History
In the first place, how did we get to using machines, and *electronic* voting machines, in elections?

Before voting machines, voting was often done by voice throughout the 1800s. Kentucky used voice voting until 1891. The first paper ballots arrive in the early 19th century.

Then came voting machines: first lever, then punch cards.

Lever voting machines have been around a long time.

![Drawing of Voting Machine](1votingmachine.jpg)

Here’s a physical example:

![Lever Voting Machine](2votingmachine.jpg)

Punch card systems were developed in the 1960s and were last used in two Idaho counties in 2014, on [the Votomatic](https://verifiedvoting.org/election-system/ess-votomatic/) provided by ES&S.

![Punch Card System](3votingmachine.jpg)

Fast forward to the 2000 presidential election between Al Gore and George W. Bush. Hanging chads on Sequoia Voting Systems punch-card voting system led to a recount, which Bush won.

![Hanging Chads](4votingmachine.jpg)

Sequoia Voting Systems got its start in the 1970s as Mathematical Systems Corporation of Anaheim, California, offering an alternative to ES&S’s Votomatic punch cards. On March 8, 2005 Smartmatic Corp. (a Venezuelan company) acquired Sequoia. This raised eyebrows since Smartmatic had only the previous year been selected to by the Chavez-era Venezuelan government to provide voting systems for the presidential recall election, it’s [first time providing machines](https://ia801704.us.archive.org/34/items/smartmatic-sequoia-and-venezuela/Smartmatic%20Sequoia%20and%20Venezuela.pdf) for an election. As of June 4, 2010 it’s parent company was Dominion Voting Systems.

According to Sequoia’s own employees, Sequoia may have [been responsible](https://web.archive.org/web/20070928013625/http://www.votetrustusa.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2560&Itemid=51) for the defective punch cards in Florida which led to “hanging chads” or undervotes to the tune of 10,000 in Palm Beach County.

One of Sequoia’s workers [told](https://web.archive.org/web/20070928013625/http://www.votetrustusa.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2560&Itemid=51) Dan Rather:

“My own personal opinion was the touch screen voting system wasn't getting off the ground like that they—like they would hope. And because they weren't having any problems with paper ballots. So, I feel like they—deliberately did all this to have problems with the paper ballots so the electronically voting systems would get off the ground—and which it did in a big way.”

Specifically, USC 52 Ch. 209 Subchapter I—PAYMENTS TO STATES FOR ELECTION ADMINISTRATION IMPROVEMENTS AND REPLACEMENT OF PUNCH CARD AND LEVER VOTING MACHINES. §20902 states: Replacement of punch card or lever voting machines.

Sequoia benefitted from the passage of federal legislation in 2002—[the Help America Vote Act of 2002](https://www.justice.gov/crt/help-america-vote-act-2002)—because *they manufactured electronic voting equipment*.

In 2003 Beverly Harris found Diebold’s source code on the internet. Diebold had only entered the elections business a year prior through its purchase of Global Elections Systems, a touch-screen voting technology producer in Texas. The source code revealed that Diebold voting systems used an unsecured access database, meaning anyone could access, change data, and erase logs.

In 2007 Diebold Election Systems rebranded as Premier Election Solutions and in 2009 they sold to Election Systems & Software (ES&S), which by 2014 was the largest manufacturer of United States voting machines.

The [Source Code Review of the Diebold Voting System](https://jhalderm.com/pub/papers/diebold-ttbr07.pdf) was published by 6 authors on July 20, 2007, showed the system was 1) vulnerable to malicious software, 2) susceptible to viruses, 3) failed to protect ballot secrecy, and 4) vulnerable to malicious insiders.

More recently, one of the authors of the Diebold review, J. Alex Halderman of Princeton University, provided [the Halderman Declaration](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21038844-20210802-expert-rebuttal-declaration-of-j-alex-halderman) on Georgia’s ballot marking devices (BMD). Halderman has also issued a sealed [25,000-word report](https://libertysword.com/expert-hackers-25000-word-secret-report-threatens-to-uncover-georgias-real-election) on voting systems vulnerabilities.

In an emergency meeting in Otero County, New Mexico in May 2022, nation-state vulnerability expert Jeff Lensberg further detailed vulnerabilities.

##Putting the History in Context

The history of voting machines spans over 100 years. However the use of electronic voting machines is very short, only two to three decades. During almost the entirety of that duration, the electronic systems have been shown to be insecure, hackable, and manipulable, sometimes if not often by design.

Their lack of certifications is further troubling.

Col. Shawn Smith, in the Tarrant County, TX meeting in the first half of 2022:

“…And for the people who said well, the machines are certified, I would say, the space shuttle Columbia was also certified for flight. How’d that turn out? The Boeing 737 Max was certified for passenger operations, and then crashed killing over 500 people in two separate accidents before they finally let experts take a look at it. And my point in saying that is not to try to scare people, but just to say that based on my experience, and I’m not a cyber professional, but I work with cyber pros, and I know the difference between somebody who knows cyber and somebody who doesn’t. And if you don’t know the difference, then you’re in very dangerous territory when you try to make any conclusions or try to listen to someone who doesn’t really know what they’re talking about.

“Our voting systems from my perspective based on the expert examiner’s report, cannot be trusted with our election. And what they require in order to for you to verify for yourself is that you become a cyber expert. Otherwise, you’re forced to trust other people who say they’re experts, people who have conflicts of interest, and people who’ve been trained essentially by the National Association of Secretaries of State, the election directors, and the Election Assistance Commission…”

###Certifications Are Less Than Useless

Throughout its [certification process](https://www.eac.gov/voting-equipment/system-certification-process), the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) which was established by [the Help America Vote Act](https://www.eac.gov/about_the_eac/help_america_vote_act.aspx) (2002) has not certified about 95% of Minnesota counties.

Those county’s electronic voting equipment are merely certified by the Minnesota Secretary of State. The few counties that are EAC certified have the problem indicated by Col. Shawn Smith, that those certifications provide the illusion of security when in fact those systems are anything but ready to run secure elections.

Let's take a look at the certification maps. Note that being certified or not certified doesn’t guarantee system security, as we shall discuss shortly.

In the following image, Red = Certified | White = Not Certified

![USA EAC Certification Map](cert_map1.png)

If we zoom in on Minnesota, we find that only 6 of 87 counties have voting equipment that is certified by the EAC. Remember, red counties are certified, white are not certified.

![MN EAC Certification Map](certmap2.png)

Here are the counties in Minnesota that are certified by the EAC:

![County EAC Certifications](certmap3.png)

Thinking that this felt off, I called the EAC and left a voicemail and sent a question by email, which was replied to the same day (04/20/2022).

![EAC email reply](certmap4.png)

This may have been comforting if not for a close reading of Minnesota election law.

[Minnesota Statute 206.57, Subd.6](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/206.57) states in full:

Subd. 6.Required certification.

In addition to the requirements in subdivision 1, a voting system must be certified by an independent testing authority accredited by the Election Assistance Commission or appropriate federal agency responsible for testing and certification of compliance with the federal voting systems guidelines at the time of submission of the application required by subdivision 1 to be in conformity with voluntary voting system guidelines issued by the Election Assistance Commission or other previously referenced agency. The application must be accompanied by the certification report of the voting systems test laboratory. A certification under this section from an independent testing authority accredited by the Election Assistance Commission or other previously referenced agency meets the requirement of Minnesota Rules, part [8220.0350](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/rules/8220.0350/), item L. A vendor must provide a copy of the source code for the voting system to the secretary of state. A chair of a major political party or the secretary of state may select, in consultation with the vendor, an independent third-party evaluator to examine the source code to ensure that it functions as represented by the vendor and that the code is free from defects. A major political party that elects to have the source code examined must pay for the examination. Except as provided by this subdivision, a source code that is trade secret information must be treated as nonpublic information, according to [section 13.37](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/13.37). A third-party evaluator must not disclose the source code to anyone else.

It is important to note that as of now there are no other appropriate federal agencies outside of the Election Assistance Commission (EAC), which itself authorizes Pro V&V and SLI Compliance.

Are There Limits to Certifications from the EAC?

Let’s take a look at the [EAC certification for Dominion 4.14-E](https://www.dropbox.com/s/b0efp9zqshzj1cm/EAC%20Report_DVS4.14E_FinalCert_FINAL_7.2.15.pdf?dl=0).

![EAC Certification for Dominion 4.14-E](certmap5.png)

On [page 1](https://www.dropbox.com/s/b0efp9zqshzj1cm/EAC%20Report_DVS4.14E_FinalCert_FINAL_7.2.15.pdf?dl=0) note the last sentence:

“This certificate is not an endorsement of the product by any agency of the U.S. Government and no warranty of the product is either expressed or implied.”

On page 2 it reads:

![Page 2 of EAC Certification for Dominion 4.14-E](certmap6.png)

Note the second to last bullet point in “Significant of EAC Certification”:
“An EAC certification is **not**: A determination that the system is ready for use in an election.”

Then what might these certifications be for?

Are they meant to give the public a false sense of security?

Finally, compare the full [14-page EAC certification](https://www.dropbox.com/s/b0efp9zqshzj1cm/EAC%20Report_DVS4.14E_FinalCert_FINAL_7.2.15.pdf?dl=0) to the State of Minnesota Secretary of State Certification of Dominion Democracy Suite Version 4.14-E Voting System reproduced below:

![Page 1 of the State of Minnesota Secretary of State Certification of Dominion Democracy Suite Version 4.14-E Voting System](certmap7.png)

And page 2 of the same:

![Page 2 of the State of Minnesota Secretary of State Certification of Dominion Democracy Suite Version 4.14-E Voting System](certmap8.png)

What did you notice?

It reads very similarly, sometimes verbatim, to the EAC’s certifications, which the EAC admits do not indicate a voting machine is ready for use in an election.

### Digging Deeper (into Known Vulnerabilities)

Should the public have questions when 81 out of 87 counties in Minnesota DO NOT have certified election equipment according to the Election Assistance Commission, which under [Minnesota Statute 206.57 Subd.6](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/206.57) those election machines should have prior to use?

Are there consequences to certifications (the EAC certifications) which have disclaimers putting the value of the certification itself into question?

What *should* these certifications imply in a more common-sense world?

In the [3/15/2022 Nye County, Nevada County Commissioner’s meeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=234&v=GBKz1o_VqAE&feature=youtu.be) cyber security consultant Mark Cook [described his experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKz1o_VqAE&t=234s) with computers pre-internet in the CompuServe and Prodigy days, then as a consultant to protect companies from threats and seal off vulnerability, and finally with election systems.

Today, Dominion is a popular voting system which uses Microsoft SQL database, one which Mark was and is very familiar with as he used SQL databases from day 1. In the same meeting, he discussed how within the first minute of getting his hands on a Dominion system, he was able to access the backend and change votes without leaving a trace.

As has now been shown, certifications (and the lack of certifications) have not protected the right of men and women to vote freely and fairly in this country. For just one example, the [Mesa County Colorado Voting Systems Report #3: Election Database and Data Process Analysis](https://magaraccoon.com/docs/MesaCountyReport3.pdf) proves database manipulation happened inside the Colorado Dominion Voting Systems (DVS) Election Management System (EMS). Not once, but twice, in both the 2020 General Election and the 2021 Grand Junction Municipal Election.

Fortunately, there are signs around the country that people are becoming aware of the fundamental issue (that these machines are designed to allow manipulation) and using their voice to affect change how their county conducts elections. Yesterday, April 19, 2022, men and women spoke in Crow Wing, Dakota, and Sherburne counties ([video from Sherburne](https://erikvanmechelen.substack.com/p/open-forum-speakers-address-removing)). Recently, two counties in Nevada, Nye and Esmeralda have already decided not to use electronic voting equipment in upcoming elections. Which county commissioners will be the first in Minnesota to do the same and restore the voice that is constitutionally inherent in the right to vote to their constituents?

##Summary

The certifications are less than meaningless.

The machines are insecure and have been from the beginning.

It may not surprise you that Sequoia, which was integral to the country pivoting to electronic voting equipment through creating the hanging chad debacle, is still involved in the elections business. Sequoia was sold to Smartmatic and their current parent company is Dominion Voting Systems.

Why do our county commissioners and election officials continue to feel confident in these systems? Why are more and more people showing up to county commissioner meetings to share what they've learned? Is it possible to return to hand tallying paper ballots?

EDIT
Next, let's begin a step by step journey following a vote through our entire election system. How a vote travels will illuminate the many flaws in our complex system.

Minnesota No. 1 in Voter ~~Turnout~~ Fraud

EDIT: remove sensationalism and sentimentality

I should have taken the September 2020 Project Veritas video about the Ilhan Omar-connected ballot harvesting scheme in Minneapolis as a sign to pay closer attention to the upcoming election. Fortunately mistakes can be learned from and put in a context which produces awareness for proper future action. Even to the point that minor mistakes are welcomed as a reality test and recalibration. But even though I went to bed early on 3 November, around 9:30 p.m., having read that the absentee ballots by the books would not need to be fully counted in battleground states on election night, when I awoke on 4 November I was nevertheless unsettled by what I came to understand happened in the early morning hours. But I didn’t have much time to dig in as we were paying a visit to my wife’s childhood friend’s family in State College, Pennsylvania the next day.

There, we were treated by our hosts to hours of uninterrupted and uncensored CNN coverage (as in 1984 the TV loomed ever-present in the background) detailing for instance Biden’s remarkable comeback turning a midnight Pennsylvania deficit of 555,189 votes into a tighter race. Attention everyone, let’s keep counting absentee ballots as long as it takes! On Saturday 7 November at 11:25 a.m. the Associated Press called the state for Biden—what gives any media outlet the authority to ‘call’ a race?—holding a 34,243 vote lead (by 15 December that was extended to a 81,660 vote margin). We were driving to the trailhead of the Thousand Steps on Jacks Mountain when my wife’s friend saw this notification and excitedly shared the news, which enlivened the mood for others in the car. I hiked peacefully enough as it really was a beautiful and sunny autumn day, however even a dip in a cold lake that afternoon could not lower my temperature enough to prevent my pent up anger spilling out that evening in an argument about whether skin color mattered relative to so many other dimensions of a human. I did not back down from but nor did I love my enemy that night. It made for an awkward breakfast the next morning where it was suggested that I might have done better to model my approach to conversation after the people of Japan, who my host had concluded on his trip there prioritize respect and politeness. The substance of the argument we had, though, has yet to be taken up. Moms and dads across the country have since made it clear in school board meetings that they understand critical race theory itself to be racist and therefore an inappropriate ideology to be peddled in publicly funded schools. At this point in my anecdote, however, I bet you haven’t failed to notice what else wasn’t said. By me.

For some reason I wasn’t ready to speak up about the election.

Meanwhile, the mainstream media was not giving up on the coverup.

Trump's lawsuits. No standing. The President of the United States had no standing. Therefore evidence wasn't shown because the vast majority of these cases didn't reach the evidentiary stage.

Early on, the media seemed to ignore election fraud news, but in February The Times went a different route. An article on the shadow campaign that saved the election included this already infamous sentence: “That’s why the participants want the secret history of the 2020 election told, even though it sounds like a paranoid fever dream—a well-funded cabal of powerful people, ranging across industries and ideologies, working together behind the scenes to influence perceptions, change rules and laws, steer media coverage and control the flow of information. They were not rigging the election; they were fortifying it.”

The fact that this article was written and published is one of many bizarre events I've noted in recent months. What these sentences describe is quite close to what happened.

Because to some extent the well funded cabal has succeeded in controlling the flow of information, the truth—including significant election-changing evidence—has taken time and effort to emerge.






Why did it take me so long to arrive in a place where I had developed the internal constitution to honestly investigate issues for myself? Why only then was I determined to think as clearly as possible while also tuning into my intuition on vital issues?

In early 2021 A friend of mine said I should watch a video interivew between Robert David Steele and Martin Geddes. This introduced me to the Q posts and got me onto Telegram.

By summer, although still working on client books, I was getting restless. A number of influencers on Telegram had said things would be cleaned up soon and Trump would be reinserted. As dates came and went, I decided I had to do something.

First I tried to go to work for Project Veritas. When that didn't work out, I found an online group on Telegram whose stated mission was to produce audits in Minnesota.

Early on, I volunteered to help moderate the chat room. Soon after, I was asked to be the lead for communications. There was also a lead for freedom of information act (FOIA) requests, documents, and research. At first there was one admin, who oversaw everything and was the liason to the national leaders. Later, she was removed and two admins were put in place. I didn't speak with any of the national leaders until a few days before I decided to leave this group about 45 days after I joined it.

Several of the relationships formed in this mostly anonymous group were maintained and became valuable.

Still, though, I didn't go to a presentation until October 2021. (Brought camera... )

Furthermore, [the exhibit describes](https://letsfixstufforg-my.sharepoint.com/personal/patrick_letsfixstuff_org/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fpatrick%5Fletsfixstuff%5Forg%2FDocuments%2FFiles%2F2020%20Election%2FLegal%2FExhibit%206%20Jim%20Penrose%20Report%2Epdf&parent=%2Fpersonal%2Fpatrick%5Fletsfixstuff%5Forg%2FDocuments%2FFiles%2F2020%20Election%2FLegal&ga=1) how the card was "utilizing a commercial Verizon SIM card with an APN configuration specific to the ES&S DS200 provisioning. Testing revealed that the same SIM card could be utilized in a separate wireless hotspot device and the device could then join the same APN as the ES&S voting machines. An unauthorized user could gain access to this APN by an extra SIM card pre-provisioned for this APN, or by removing a SIM from an operational device and using it in another device."

To repeat: This wireless modem was found on an enclosed part of the machine. Therefore if these same or similar wireless modems were also installed on the DS200s throughout Minnesota, it would be invisible to election judges, poll challengers, and even election officials.

Are you concerned that contracts with our hardware and software vendors makes it very difficult to inspect the machines or source code? Does it worry you that Minnesota Statutes make it difficult to have this done? 19 months after November 3rd, 2020, don't you think it would have been prudent to have settled the conspiracy theories by showing the public that the machines are clean?

Neither the chair of a major political party nor the secretary of state asked for a third party to inspect the source code of the machines, which [Minnesota Statute 206.57 Subd.6](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/206.57) allows for.

Furthermore, according to [Patrick Colbeck](https://letsfixstuff.org/2022/05/beware-of-just-count-the-ballots-narrative/), "only a full forensic audit of the entire election record chain of custody can determine whether or not an election was conducted with integrity."

Even with the defense phase (cover up and destruction of evidence) of the election coup falling apart, so far no county commissions (in Minnesota) have decided to return to hand counting paper ballots as many of their constituents desire—instead, counties plan to run elections on very similar if not the same software which managed the 2020 election. This would be unwise if fair and transparent elections are desired.

I fully support the many people continuing to go to their county commissioner board meetings to inform them of available fixes to restore trust to all voters.


BRING TODD COUNTY HERE

(Anecdote about why I sent a data request to Todd County...




## Summary from Jeffrey O'Donnell

The following post from Jeffrey O'Donnell, aka 'The Lone Raccoon' on Telegram, describes how the enemy's defense has been weakened:

"I joined this fight full time more than nine months ago. I wilfully pushed the pause button on our lives and trusted God to provide - and he has. I have a new appreciation for the Israelites who were given manna to survive - each day's needs are supplied. The next week or month... that's where faith and trust come in. At that time, Lindell's symposium had just happened and everyone thought the pcap information would save us. We were wrong. Specifically speaking,

* the process of defining the algorithms used to sway the election was still in its infancy, with Ed Solomon and Draza Smith only just starting to be able to describe the process

* State voter rolls were being only cursorily examined, and little comparison was being done between states

* The inner workings of the election servers was still a complete mystery

* Most analysis of the 2020 fraud was being done by people within counties. Very little information was being shared between states or even counties

* The clues to the whole thing in the Edison election night reporting were seen but not yet understood

* No effort existed to collect, analyze, and share election data such as cast vote records and ballot images. The importance of Cast Vote Records in this fight was really not recognized yet.

* Although "phantom" absentee votes were suspected, their prevalence and widespread abuse was not generally known yet.

* Protecting 2022/2024, while on people's radar, had no viable plan."

The Lone Raccoon goes on to contrast that August 2021 position with the June 2022 position:

"Now look at today.

* the algorithm used by the election servers is well understood and can even be predicted now
* Tremendous problems with voter rolls have been loudly documented in many states.
* We have a full understanding of the internal working of the Dominion system, with other vendors soon to come.
* There is coordination and cooperation - and healthy competition - between groups in different states
* Edison has been revealed to be a conspirator in the election plot, and while much is still not understood, the "edison zero" and the flipping of votes between absentee and in-person has been well-documented, as has the fact that the reporting is largely theater and does not match up well with the actual results in a state/county until the very end,
* Cast Vote Records, ballot images, tabulator logs, voter rolls/histories and more have been obtained from many counties in many states, and their analysis has proved crucial. Any bit of data we get from a county is something they cannot destroy in September.
* Massive absentee ballot fraud is a fact.
* Findings from 2020 are being used in many ways to minimize the fraud potential in future elections... plus the identification of any fraud now takes minutes rather than months.
* Serious court cases (much better than the quick ones done right after the election) are progressing in numerous states"

Where are the arrests? Please do not be naïve. We are forced to be a citizen's Justice Department, because our country does not currently have a functioning one. Our burden of proof is immense and unfair. We have no subpeona or warrant power. You need to think of this for what it is - a national RICO case. Read how Guliani broke up the mobs in New York. He built his case from the ground up and quietly climbed the ladder of corruption until he had the goods on ALL the bosses. Then he struck."







OUTTAKES... or CONSIDERATIONS ... ?




QUOTED FROM OPENING OF THIS CHAPTER


-summary point - chair calls paper ballot, saboteurs
-summary point - electronic voting devices, lol
-...
-was there vote shaving w/ Padgett? (Munson quote from Jamie?)
-kim/kelly no endorsement in my opinion OR kelly was asked to step aside and did so
-endorsements run on electronic voting equipment with no transparent verification (COMPARE David Haan's emails prior with what they did/didn't do at convention... and Neil Shah asks for audits, receives no response)
-calls for unity... but chair does not model this behavior... instead trying to silence free speech lol

-my story so far...
-given incorrect info by my own bpou chair:
-...no money
-...stiff competition
-...cd8 says to mark, don't have me on
-...diana friemann, olmsted gop pushback
-all this to be expected because secretary of state is a crucial role for establishment to own - look at the behavior of secretaries of state across the nation - how many seem to care about the election coup? how many have demonstrated through decisive actions how they care about it? (see New Mexico... provide links to David Clements' work, incestuous, etc.)
-part of reason you must share this free book
-because the information must get to those who are curious to know, to those who weren't at precinct, bpou, and state conventions, but who as citizens have a right to know





quote from kelly, or

quote from isabel?

Isabelle,
from Ecuador
communism, mom and dad lost everything
she wanted to speak about the machines
it possibly was "out of order"
so she was asked to stop speaking
she went back to her seat, clearly distraught
i went a few sections over to her, looking for her make america great again hat
found her, crying
i said she did the right thing
to speak the truth
then she told me
people here don't understand
what don't they understand?
what's going to happen
tells me story of mom and dad


Will be critical and ask questions.

helped get legislators to cyber symposium
even got meeting with Eric Mortensen with Dr. Douglas Frank
apparently ball was in Frank's court and didn't follow up with Mortensen
unfortunate because when I spoke with Mortensen about it in late April, 2022, at the CD3 convention (I was there doing recon, hoping to speak with Kim and Kelly as I weighed the decision to run for secretary of state)
Mortensen seemed to still have a bad taste in his mouth about it
but the reality was there were great presenations and info shared
like this one (parable of the traffickers, which has been shown to be correct in spirit through the work of True the Vote's Katherine Engelbrecht and Gregg Phillips, showcased in 2000 mules )
or this talk from phil waldron, etc.
or this one looking at the before / after image (Tina Peters) now subject of
the [S]election Code (selectioncode.com) docuementary.
so
it is too bad that in my opinion we haven't heard much from these folks
i donated to lucero at the launch of the child protection Something (that michelle lentz invited me to)
and told him i was at the cyber symposium
because he only vaguely recalled speaking with me there
where he seemed a bit nervous that I was a writer
"I still don't work for anyone" i said,
i said thank you for keeping election integrity in mind
but he didn't share more about his plans there
and this legislative session was sorely lacking
^
do i need to be this critical, only if they actually haven't said anything.

the truth is the commissioners need spine, that can help

but need constituents
need legislators
need judges
need executive branch

all have to have spine, principles, courage

Because without access to information, how can the public make informed decisions? How can you give informed consent? How can you live in the truth if you aren't aware of it?

project veritas, focus on somali community
bigger story is 2000 mules
videographer tells me they are trying to connect to culture
pull stories often after they've done much work on them
fundraising emails and letters:
we want to cover election fraud, but we need more money
where are the stories about election machines?
(robert barnes - desantis doesn't have an election fraud problem)

put all the stories from CD5 show

clay county
michelle benson's son
Paul "Hold the Line" Gazelka
Eric "Dems stopped all our election integrity bills" Lucero
Glenn "I wrote the voter id bill" Gruenhagen

look for press releases about the cyber symposium.


to add, edwin's cease and desist letter to david haan?

It takes very little talent or creativity to complain about problems.  After all, the people directly impacted by a problem, and eventually those indirectly impacted by the problem, feel the weight and consequences stemming from it.  When I speak in front of an audience, I need not complain at length about the violations of liberty underway in America, because the people know the personal toll exacted by those who corrupt the foundation of self-government.  The audiences come to hear solutions and to commit to action.

"After we kick electronic voting systems out of our country, and go back to all-paper, one-day elections - we need to make Election Day a national holiday. It needs to be a holiday not for convenience or to make sure everyone has time to get to the polls. It needs to be a holiday so that once a year we will remember how Americans defeated tyranny within our borders for a second time. That we reaffirmed that our rights come from our Creator and our liberty is a responsibility. And under that framework our government derives its powers only from the consent of the governed."

Perhaps most important is that you stay as informed as you can while continuing to ask questions. The powers that be don't like when we [submit FOIA or public data requests for CVRs](https://rumble.com/vyy792-foia-request-for-report-of-cast-vote-record-cvr.html), show up at county commissioner meetings to share evidence, or otherwise use our first amendment rights, but if we don't hold those in public office accountable, who will? We are the people we've been waiting for. Put on the full armor of God. Join me in reclaiming the government for We the People.

If you do decide to vote for me and we are still relying on electronic voting machines for the Primary (August 9th) and the General Election (November 8th), please cast your vote in-person at your precinct on election day. If enough of you do this, there could be a chance to overwhelm the algorithms.

But, after I've written this book, do you really think that Dominion, ES&S, or Hart will (s)elect me in the primary? If I somehow get through the primary, how about the general?

Candidates who have campaigned for over a year are now starting to see results in their primary races that defy trends and sometimes logic, getting them invested in helping to spread the truth about the machines.






206.56 subd 8
an electronic voting sys includes ....

In Minnesota Statute 206.56 Subd. 8. Electronic voting system.

"Electronic voting system" means a system in which the voter records votes by means of marking a ballot, so that votes may be counted by automatic tabulating equipment in the polling place where the ballot is cast or at a counting center.

An electronic voting system includes automatic tabulating equipment; nonelectronic ballot markers; electronic ballot markers, including electronic ballot display, audio ballot reader, and devices by which the voter will register the voter's voting intent; software used to program automatic tabulators and layout ballots; computer programs used to accumulate precinct results; ballots; secrecy folders; system documentation; and system testing results.







If possible I would have run for office with no party affiliation, especially after learning about evidence of election tampering in the MNGOP precinct caucuses, in my opinion remaining unaddressed and unresolved. The secretary of state's responsibilities should obviously be non-partisan. However, since it is not possible when running for secretary of state in Minnesota to have no party affiliation, I will run as a republican.

Even though to my knowledge inspection has not been allowed to occur on ES&S's Electionware election management system, I am eager to

Fortunately, there are signs around the country that people are becoming aware of the fundamental issue (that these machines are designed to allow manipulation) and using their voice to affect change how their county conducts elections. Yesterday, April 19, 2022, men and women spoke in Crow Wing, Dakota, and Sherburne counties ([video from Sherburne](https://erikvanmechelen.substack.com/p/open-forum-speakers-address-removing)). Recently, two counties in Nevada, Nye and Esmeralda have already decided not to use electronic voting equipment in upcoming elections. Which county commissioners will be the first in Minnesota to do the same and restore the voice that is constitutionally inherent in the right to vote to their constituents?

Recommendations - Paper

*"The highest priority as a bad guy would be to subvert our election system. The reason is: you can take over a country without firing a shot. If you can decide who the leaders are, if you can put judges, if you can answer constitutional questions any which you want, over a period of time—you're not going to do it in one election, it's going to take a bunch of elections—but you can take over a country. And that would be my top priority (as a bad guy). Nuclear weapons would be a close second, but the top one would be elections."*

Jeff Lensberg, nation-state vulnerability expert in the May 9, 2022 Otero County, New Mexico Emergency meeting

*“That we’ve been duped.”*

*“Yes, so what’s stopping us from reformulating our election processes as you described earlier and then immediately calling for new elections?”*

*“Nothing.”*

—From a conversation between Col. Phil Waldren and the author inside The Military Heritage Alliance around 6pm on Day Three of Mike Lindell’s Cyber Symposium in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

***

Let’s start with where we are headed.

We are on our way to a future where every voter’s vote is counted and 100% auditable immediately. See [this video clip](https://youtu.be/GBKz1o_VqAE?t=2421) from Col. Phil Waldron in a Nye County Commissioner’s meeting in March 2022 where a resolution was passed by the commissioners 5-0 to remove electronic voting equipment from future elections. (They weren’t the only county in Nevada to do so.)

A win for the enemy is to keep electronic voting machines and systems. We cannot allow that to happen. That is, if you understand the anomalies, indications, and evidence showing what these machines and their code are capable of.

Elections have become too complicated. And complexity breeds corruption. By contrast, simplicity yields success.

Elections should be:
	- A single day, probably a national holiday
	- Machine-less
	- Decentralized to promote local oversight and control
	- Conducted with paper ballots, hand counted, that are 100% auditable immediately

Elections should **not** have:
	- Dropboxes
	- Mail-in ballots
	- Long absentee and early voting periods
	- Machine-driven check-in (epollbooks)
	- Machine-driven counting and tallying (tabulators)
	- Machine-driven adjudicating and recording (election management systems)

In Minnesota, the already opaque computer systems are increasingly networked and centralized. When centralized, it is easier for just a few bad actors to control election outcomes.

Those who control the machines, control who wins.

This short book will shine light on exactly how that happens.

But if you’ve already lost confidence in machine-driven elections, you may want to hear some of the objections made against moving to hand-counting paper so that you can be ready to counter them.

***

Objections to the above have come from expected places, like the media, part of the cover-up, who have been forced to shift their language from a) no evidence of fraud to b) no widespread evidence of fraud to c) not significant enough fraud to alter the election outcome to d) admitting that Dominion machines can be hacked (CNN).

Some objections have also come from legislators. In Minnesota I've heard more than once: “We can’t get voter ID past the Democrats.”

Responses like this are in part discouraging because voter ID is only one simple change that is needed. Further, to make elections truly fair again would require the legislature to amend Minnesota statutes or write new ones, like the banning of electronic voting equipment.

But there is good news: once the majority of Minnesotans learn how vulnerable the machines and computer systems currently in use are, legislators on both sides of the aisle will be hearing regularly from the people who will be able to articulate exactly what they want.

Other objections have come from local county government. Having sat in meetings with county commissioners and election officials, if they agree that the machines are vulnerable and realize the people no longer trust them, the common objections I’ve heard can be summarized by concerns about time, effort, and money.

Time:
Hand counting paper takes longer than feeding ballots through a machine. However, what’s more important than speed is accuracy. 18 months after the November 3rd 2020 general election, we are still “counting”.

Effort:
Manual labor is required to hand-count paper ballots. With enough paid staff or volunteers the overall effort is spread across those doing the work. (I imagine many people in all 87 Minnesota counties would enthusiastically join an effort to produce the first non-machine election result in decades.) Also, if the 46-day absentee election were removed, that would save election officials and ballot boards 46 days of work.

Money:
Rick Weible has compared the net cost per ballot with machines versus paper. Machine counting costs about $14 per ballot. With paper counting, costs would be cut in half to about $7 per ballot. Hand counting paper not only costs tax payers less in the long run but it also produces reliable and auditable results which could restore confidence in the overall election process and go a long way to minimizing fraud.

Public county commissioners board meetings every two weeks have been increasingly attended in late 2021 and early 2022 in Minnesota and across the country because changes can be made within local jurisdictions without changes to election law from the legislature. This is where the people’s voice can truly be heard and county commissioners can even add a discussion of election systems and processes as an agenda item. If change is desired, a resolution can be brought and voted upon. A no-confidence vote on the machines can lead to real change.

Objections have also come from the offices of the secretary of state throughout the country. In Minnesota, Secretary of State Steve Simon decline the opportunity to prove the electronic election equipment in Crow Wing County was secure when he denied the opportunity brought by a 4-1 county commissioners vote to unseal the ballots from the Crow Wing County 2020 General Election. A simple hand tallying of the paper ballots for the presidential race alone would have allowed that tally to be compared with the results reported by the Secretary of State's office. If the the hand tally matched the machine-reported counts, then trust may have been restored. Instead, the people are left to wonder why this simple request was dismissed and what was meant be his official response to the Crow Wing County Commissioners, which in part read:

"Unfortunately this is another example, I fear, of disinformation taking root. A generalized feeling or vibe or hunch — and it's probably being stirred up and whipped up by those with a political or financial interest in corroding democracy."

This from a Secretary of State who already admitted ...  tiny fraud every election ...

END



...

To list only a few areas where county commissioners can make change happen right now:

LIST 1
Counties may discontinue electronic pollbooks (e-pollbooks) and return to paper pollbooks, according to Minnesota Statute 201.225 Subd.1 https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/201.225 “A county, municipality, or school district may use electronic rosters for any election.”

LIST 2
Counties may also do away with machines *** statute number. (Nathan Org disagrees, but let’s see.)

As the two buses converged from the left and right into our lane I wondered whether this road was safe for bicycles. When we’d agreed to tea fifteen minutes prior my family wasn’t expecting to navigate a minor highway on two wheels. Our tour guide slipped through the gap, not far behind were Mom and Dad who decided to go for it. My brothers and I were forced to brake and cars behind us honked, not in solidarity, but at least they didn’t hit us. Losing sight of Mom and Dad as the buses zipped the lane shut, I briefly imagined them being crushed. Moments later, materializing out of the cloud of exhaust on that hazy winter morning were Mom and Dad and the guide, each still in their saddle. It was 2005 and there were far fewer bikes in Beijing than I’d recalled in our 1998 visit. Just before the people’s uprising in Jakarta prompted Suharto to step aside from the Presidency after a thirty-two-year reign, on one day’s notice we flew into Singapore; after receiving word that school was canceled for the year, we decided to visit China.

Biking through Beijing, we navigated the tight alleys, connecting traditional courtyard residences in Old Beijing, some dating back to the thirteenth century. Parking next to a red door beneath a slanting tiled roof, our guide knocked and announced us. A smiling, elderly woman answered and soon we stepped over the threshold and were shown to a small room adjacent the courtyard. Without heating we did not take off our coats, but here at least the walls sheltered us from the wind’s bite. We were all keen for the hot tea she soon brought but especially thankful was my older brother whose frozen hands around the cup were eventually thawed, albeit painfully. We sat around a low stone table and sipped our tea while our guide translated the woman’s story, her family’s history, and what life was like in her community. Having expended considerable physical effort and survived both the elements and the attempted bus squeeze, we were as travelers taking temporary refuge from a storm, content for simple pleasures. We were soon transported through time by our host’s tale.
After receiving my high school diploma from the International School of Beijing in 2006, I soon returned to the United States to attend college in Minnesota. In short order however I learned that back in the Chinese capital several thousand traditional homes just like the one we’d visited, along with their more than seven hundred years of history, were bulldozed. Ostensibly this was done to make room for sports venues and other infrastructure for the 2008 Olympic Games, but word on the street was that the Party was embarrassed by the hutong, which were downtrodden and often occupied by the poor. I learned that the residents at the time of their evictions were not compensated appropriately to the point that they couldn’t easily find other places to live.
We lived in Shunyi District, a rural area east of Beijing. The street between our school and the local villages was still covered in fall by corn kernels laid to dry by farmers. In their communities my new school friends once treated me to a plentiful noon meal for about a dollar a person.

![Corn Drying on Road](corn.png)

It was not clear how long these rural areas would last as the city expanded eastward toward us. I remember large clusters of residential apartment buildings rising quickly from the landscape, one day webbed by bamboo scaffolding, completed the next. To this day I wonder how many of the workers who toiled all day and through the night were not Chinese but North Korean workers on surreptitious loan. The pace of building in the last decade contributed to the ghost city phenomenon; the sociological manifestation of a “one child” policy the Chinese ruling class boasted of—as the rest of the world shrugged its shoulders. While my two brothers and I sat in a tea shop near the Terra Cotta warriors museum in Xi'an, a plate of melon arrived without our request, the server murmuring "san ge, san ge" (three) as she stepped away.

Prior to our arrival I knew little about China. When I shared my family was moving to Beijing, my history teacher in Houston remarked, “That’s interesting. You know, China is a Communist country!” Actually, I didn’t really know. I thought the term merely referred to an economic system. At age seventeen without the context of Communist disasters throughout history, I was going in blind.

![Bamboo scaffolding](bamboo.jpg)

It would take years for my eyes to be truly opened. But my first glimpses of understanding came in the usual ways: exploring my surroundings, conversations, books. With my adventurous mother I walked the wild sections of the Great Wall and glimpsed how the people lived in the villages nestled against the ancient divider visible from space. On my return in 2008, I chatted with migrant workers outside the gates of East China Normal University in Shanghai while they cooked dumplings or slapped dough on the inside of a metal barrel. The bread man travelled daily from outside the sprawling city, here standing all day in the cold to sell portions for a quarter a piece. I bought a decent amount but in my defense, he was competing with other sellers. I came to learn through my classmate Deanna’s research that he was one of approximately 300 million migrant workers throughout the country, at the time equivalent to the entire population of the United States. The international press lauded the country’s economic growth but there was a tragic number of people yet to rise out of poverty.

It was a rough present, but their near-term past was arguably tougher. Mao’s policies devastated the country and as a result tens of millions of lives were lost. The chaperone of the 2008 trip, an economics professor who grew up during the Cultural Revolution, shared with me how she and her grandmother hid in the kitchen stove when Mao’s Red Guards showed up unannounced and took her father away, never to be seen again. In Ji Xianlin’s *The Cowshed: Memories of the Chinese Cultural Revolution*, I learned how a once-respected professor was interrogated by his own students and made to build a holding cell for he and fellow intellectual colleagues labeled class enemies. These were commonplace experiences, normalizing total control of the mind and body for what no one in their right mind (not even Mao) would truly suffer. The total control of the Chinese population was first instantiated in fear, then through elections, establishing a uniparty governance model since the foundation of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in 1949.

While I didn’t have a robust understanding of the comparative political models in question, I knew that when I left China it wasn’t a place I would ever want to live for very long. Evenings walking our neighborhood I wondered whether the guards were there for our safety or as our monitors. Below two fire alarms, the purpose of the second my family never did surmise, our living room television regularly went static at any mention of China. Our church services were held in a conference room since there were no churches and Chinese nationals were forbidden from attending.

When I moved back to the States I had a deeper appreciation for the spirit of freedom, central to our founding and identity. As rumors of mysterious virus spread in early 2020, I immediately sensed a contest of ideas was about to play out. An attempt at total control was being instantiated with fear. Little did I know that an election would follow.

•

By mid-summer of 2020, videos documenting the horrors of the Chinese Cultural Revolution were circulating on YouTube. After several weeks of violence plaguing cities around the United States, loudly—though in substance quite loosely—tethered to the death of several United States citizens who the corporate media branded as victims. The corporate sponsored revolutionaries used the color of these citizen’s skin as justification for their looting, pillaging, assaulting, and killing. The corporate media and intellectual class graced these actors with the blessed heritage of “peaceful protest,” as small businesses were destroyed, communities (many of them populated by racial and ethnic minorities) gutted, and cities burned. No one seemed to bother to check the police reports. Why would they? Instagram and Facebook already told them what happened, and whose name (no matter how criminal, felonious, or murderous) to say. The same tactics the Maoist used in the previous century to upend China were on display in my home country—tearing down statues, disgracing public buildings, ridiculing our history, shaming any who would defend it. Where the American version of the red army (the black shirts) stopped short was public beheadings—perhaps knowing that the constitutional right to bear arms and form militias would put a swift end to what could be accomplished with a more measured and insidious approach.

Living in Minneapolis, the totalitarian flavor of the air, food, and water I remembered in Beijing was asserting itself in my own backyard.

After months of isolation, fear, confusion, anxiety, and frustration, with (major sporting leagues around the world shut down) nothing to watch and nowhere to go, a series of provocative images from the corner of 38th and Chicago in Minneapolis’s Powderhorn neighborhood lit a powder keg. The nation, within moments, went from “stronger together” to irredeemably and systemically racist. With half-truth history populating the minds of the highly educated and the pages of the New York Times, the Maoist attempt at unraveling of the American consciousness was now out in the open. Minneapolis would be center stage of the supposedly anti-fascist to deliver their first blow to the supposedly white supremacist fabric of our nation’s past, present, and future. Soon, the epicenter of the charade would ripple out to its final landing place in Portland where the (apparently well-funded) black shirts terrorized a city ironically praised for its leftist ideals. But while the nightly news celebrated the “mostly peaceful” protests that were plainly seen as nothing of the sort, a more profound war was raging across the country in state houses of government and county elections commissions…

From Patrick Colbeck's *The 2020 Coup: What Happend. What We Can Do.*, the preparation phase (before the attack, backup attack, and defense phases) was well under way. The elections commissions, the non-profits, the state legislatures, judicial permissions, and corporate media swirled in a whirlwind of confusion that unconstitutionally set the election to the tune they wanted to play.

By the next summer, I was working with men and women around the state searching for a way to properly and seriously audit Minnesota's election results. Being a part of that group got me an invite to the Cyber Symposium. That week in Sioux Falls, South Dakota helped me understand what was at stake. Shortly after I joined a decentralized national working group uncovering the truth about elections. Most recently my work led to county commissioner meetings in Dakota, Sherburne, and Wright County and closed door meetings with commissioners and election officials in Dakota and Morrison County. Through this work I've met Minnesotans from all walks of life fighting for their state and ultimately their lives through a dedication to the truth.

What we know now is that those who control the machines, control the results. So long as we have machines, I will not feel any confidence whatsoever that my vote was counted.

From the 100,000-foot view, elections are simply a control mechanism and also a critical vector of attack against a nation-state. Here in the United States, if you can install candidates up and down the ballot, then a county, state, and country can be usurped without firing a bullet. Meanwhile, the people could be manipulated for years or decades to think all is well in our constitutional republic, including election judges, poll challengers, and election officials.

Of course, control through elections is not new, even if this important fact is not well understood.

In Robert A. Caro’s Working, he describes the importance of facts being made available to the public, one of which was the fact that in 1948 at the eleventh hour two hundred votes were found for Lyndon B. Johnson propelling him into the Texas Senate by a margin of eighty-seven votes in a race where more than a million votes were cast. Caro found the man responsible for carrying this out, Luis Salas, who invited him into his home where he admitted to Caro what he did and that he lied under oath about it. He gave Caro a manuscript describing his actions. Caro writes, “Thanks to that manuscript, it would not be necessary for me to write, ‘No one will ever be sure if Lyndon Johnson stole it.’ He stole it.”

That was in 1948.

Like Caro, I couldn’t look away from what I was seeing in late 2020 and 2021. In Patrick Colbeck's framework, the preparation phase had led into the attack phase (where the mail-in ballot weakness was exploited) followed by the backup attack phase (where votes were injected electronically), and we had entered the defense phase (where election evidence was covered up or destroyed).

Even despite the lack of cooperation from elected officials, locally people like Rick Weible showed me so much evidence that I couldn't stand aside. From others around the country sharing information with me, I gradually learned how our elections were supposed to work, and how they had been taken over. The election theft in 2020 was obviously coordinated. If this has been happening for a long time, why only now was it so obvious?

How was it that I'd so far lived my life believing my vote counted, but now could not so easily answer that question? That will take some time to unpack. But one thing is clear: Since November 3rd, 2020, tens of millions, if not more, have asked or are now beginning to ask, Does my vote count?

If our election officials, counties, and secretaries of state cannot show that the computerized election management systems used to produce election results actually do so without error, then citizens in increasing numbers will have the same question—Does my vote count? Jeffrey O'Donnell puts it well in the introduction to his Mesa County #3 Report: "If Americans' votes are to be recorded and counted by machines, every aspect of those machines' operation, configuration, and data must be recorded, immediately available at no cost or administrative burden to citizens and their independent examiners and confirmed 100% accurate through that independent verification. The absence or shortfall of any of those three imperatives (recorded, available, and independently verified) should immediately cause the public to distrust both the purported results from those machines, and also anyone who insists that they accept those results."

To date, no independent audit of the machines has been done of any Minnesota county. Neither has a third party been tasked with inspecting the source code of the machines. And #3...
(in MN statute, this can be done)

RESULT?
machines NOT ACCEPTABLE
paper, ACCEPTABLE - NOW


(Because they couldn't have another 4 years of Trump.)






MOVE MINNESOTA SECTION to CHAPTER 2 or later...


Near the basement entrance to VFW Post 494 in Crystal, MN, I was soon asked whether I would like to wear a sticker by a man working with one of the campaigns. When I declined he said, "I understand not wanting to be a walking poster." Nodding, I pulled back my jacket to reveal my t-shirt and said, "But I already am."

The t-shirt read:

Minnesota, No. 1 in Voter ~~Turnout~~ Fraud

Instead of a walking poster for any one candidate, I would go on to advocate for the issue I was surprised to learn that few wanted to discuss that day.

At this, the CD5 Convention of the Minnesota Republican Party, nearly 17 months after the November 3rd, 2020 General Election, very few if any speakers acknowledged that the election was rigged and none mentioned electronic voting equipment (epollbooks, tabulators, election management systems). Stating the obvious would surely have scored them political points (or so I thought) so why was almost everyone shying away? Only by plainly stating the problem is there any chance of going about fixing it. What's more, at this late hour, we're at a moment where surface level issues of the election coup are obvious—because elections have consequences we are witnessing the decades long result of leaders being (s)elected, not elected. It is easy to complain and feel good about knowing some fact that your neighbor may not yet know. But now the focus should be on solutions and taking action toward them. In the realm of elections, there are simple remedies to the overly complex and easily exploitable system currently in place.

Rolling back the clock a bit, I don't pretend that I understood exactly what was happening on November 3rd, 2020 as it was happening. On election night (and day 46 of the absentee voting period in Minnesota), I had gone to bed early having read that absentee ballots in some states did not need to be fully counted for some days yet. Who would it benefit to have the work done so as to declare the winner on election night? The American people. But the failed and corrupt political establishment did not want that.

When I woke up, and in the following days, I became gradually aware of the many things wrong with our election process and systems. Many of which, whether legislative, procedural, or technical, are design features, not bugs. The breach of the border between legal and ethical domains has helped naysayers and coverup artists stall efforts to correct what went awry, but eventually God's tortoises will beat Lucifer's hares.

Although I'd been properly jolted from my comfortable lifestyle it took a good deal of time and effort to equip myself to understand better what had happened, how it had been done, when and where, and by whom. The answers to Why? have produced further inquiry at times beyond the scope of this text.

Whenever possible I'd like to focus on the open source intelligence. The raw data. (Increasingly, this is the approach more people will take realizing they cannot trust even their favorite newscasters, influencers, and reporters to draw conclusions from the data on their behalf – truth repositories akin to Project Apario's proof of concept will grow in popularity and importance.) Since I voted and live in Minnesota, the focus will be in the land of more than 14,000 lakes [https://seagrant.umn.edu/news-information/directors-column/minnesota-land-how-many-lakes](about 14,380).

Even while focusing on verifiable facts, I will not hesitate to ask questions or suggest routes you may walk yourself. And remember, the truth will resonate from within. There is great potential within each of us. Be humble and do not underestimate your ability to search, research, dig, and discern. May God grant us allow wisdom, strength, and discernment to carry the burden that is His truth. Only then may we see clearly and help others also come to see the lies and therefore remove the power of that deception.
