It's a choice to remain a slave. Or to be free. The gangsters and slavemasters don't like dissidents and rebels. They will try to put you back in your place. Where they will continue to exploit you and your children as has been occurring since long before any of you reading this were born.

But the planet can be reclaimed. Cherish every day and realize your options. Help yourself. Help one another. Use the tools you have. Advance. Accountability is key. If contracts have been breached there's no need to remain in them. Align with the truth instead. But there's a catch. Once you start on this path, you can't go back. Slavemasters don't treat runaway slaves nicely.

The age old question: What is to be done?

Paradoxically, change only happens when we fully identify what is, not what could be or should be. 

It starts by looking in the mirror.

In 2022 Minnesota used almost the same [s]election process and electronic voting system (including an opaque statewide voter registration system) as were used in 2020, an election which the MNSOS cannot prove was not stolen and even passed on an opportunity to do this in Crow Wing County in January 2022. Stolen not from republican voters but from the people. Not only were processes and systems equivalent but election laws went nearly unchanged and very similar direction came down to the counties, auditors, and clerks from the Office of the Secretary of State (OSS).

On the process side, that includes 1,140 forced mail-in precincts and legal mail-in absentee ballots and legal dropboxes (approved by republican and democratic legislators) across the state. 

The electronic voting system includes but is not limited to e-pollbooks (iPads), internet hot spots, tabulators (with modems), election management software, and the digital statewide voter registration system. According to Col. Shawn Smith who has done operational testing and oversight for the Department of Defense, none of the current electronic voting systems can be secured from cyber threats and their hardware components are delivered through insecure foreign supply chains. Current testing protocols fail to account for even basic threats and forensic audits are rarely done. Features like remote accessibility or detection-less vote swapping pointed out and demonstrated by Jeffrey Lenberg present further issues.

Election laws like Minnesota Statute 203B.121 which says counts will occur for absentee ballots only after 8pm on election day is violated as per the OSS direction to begin putting ballots into the central scanners 7-14 days in advance—this occurred during the 2022 midterms. In fact several county auditors confirmed this was their plan.

Almost every county certified without complete data (according to the OSS's own data) and the state certified the results in spite of that as well. Despite nearly the same process, electronic systems, laws, and direction from the OSS, many still hoped that results would be different.

I did not agree with this wishful thinking. 

It requires a certain level of spiritual groundedness to fend off psychological and pyschic attacks, hopium, propaganda, and depressive or even apathetic moods. It is fair to say there is a war for our very consciousness. Vibing high is a narrow path of courage, acceptance, willingness, love (wanting the best for neighbors as ourselves), and peace. I was disappointed more hadn't worked alongside me and others throughout 2021 and 2022 to spark local change in city councils, township boards, or commissioner board meetings. But then maybe I hadn't properly shared my experience at dozens of these meetings and others with auditors or election employees, including in Sherburne, Dakota, Wright, Stearns, Carver, Faribault, Morrison, Anoka, and Hennepin County. This book is an effort to make good on a commitment toward accountability and transparency in government.

On Nov 8, I paid a visit to my local polling place to not only cast my vote but to see whether I could spot issues or plant seeds of doubt with the election judges on the off chance they would choose not to sign the summary statements which ask them to verify the tabulator tallies, an impossible ask without a hand count. (A question about which, when posed by citizens in Anoka County, had them removed from election judge rosters.) 

I voted reluctantly for the rather weak Minnesota Republicans to defend against a potential election cartel plan to give a few Republicans a seat at the table so as to wake fewer people up to the overall rigged game, which could be a part of what is transpiring on the national level in the contest for the US House and Senate, at least on the surface (Arizona and Nevada took absurdly long to count and the cartel somehow "found" enough votes to defeat Kari Lake). As for Minnesota, it is possible that for the immediate term we got exactly the results we needed to test our spirit and inspire further coordinated engagement focused on the root of the problem. 

Allow me to explain. Some were angry or even depressed by the unofficial results. Unofficial because the results must first be canvassed and certified at the county and then the state level by county and state canvassing boards. (Note: These boards do not have to dig into the numerous statistical anamolies already demonstrated, but only review the summary statements printed by the tabulators.) Election contests can be filed and recounts, including discretionary recounts, can be asserted. (I would hope that Auditor candidate Ryan Wilson, who sold his company recently for large sums of money, is willing to pay for a discretionary recount of his very close race, within 1%. He says he cares about daycare and food fraud—let's hope he cares about election fraud too. However my suspicion is that he was never a representative of the people given his silence on election integrity and as evidenced by his $400 gift of alcohol to now senate-elect Nathan Wesenberg after Wesenberg's primary win in SD10. More to come on Wesenberg's story since it is critical to understanding MNGOP-committed delegate election fraud, which Wesenberg helped to expose. I would also hope Jim Schultz joins the election fraud effort given how close his race was, but perhaps the possibility of a campaign finance fine will deter him.)

I was neither angry nor depressed when I saw the outcomes early on Nov 9 (rising for 6:15am workout). Nor did the unofficial results have me cowering in fear at how powerful the cartel must be to produce such an outcome. My role is to join with millions of others in using our God given voices to call out what we see that is happening. Gregg Phillips announced that in Alegheny, Pennsylvania, election files were given to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the People's Liberation Army (PLA). It now makes very clear why the DC FBI took over from the Texas FBI who were originally working on the Konnech case with Phillips and True the Vote founder, Katherine Engelbrecht, and why both Phillips and Engelbrecht were put in prison for a few days. 

From this simple fact alone we know this is not a Democrat Party versus Republican Party problem (in fact it's likely that many "leaders" in those parties are complicit in covering up the fraud). Those that were tricked into the D/R way of thinking or had deceived themselves to that end would have been more likely to react negatively to the way the media's reporting of the results—why are you listening to the media's reporting? They lied about the virus and almost everything else for as long as they've been in existence and are owned by a small powerful group of people. 

Instead, the clearest early view of the results I was able to access came through the Edison Research feed to CNN, which Jeffrey O'Donnell spent 5 hours connecting after NY Times decided not to make its feed available. Therefore only state level, not county level, data was available (unlike the primary). 

Another reason not to be surprised was that I didn't perceive nor was privy to existing counter operations at scale needed to stop black market ballots delivered to dropboxes, as was highlighted in 2000 Mules. (These black market ballots can be linked to the statewide voter registration system to actual voters who do not vote and to a slush fund of phantom voters that are difficult for citizens to purge since the OSS controls the statewide voter registration system.) However operations elsewhere like Patrick Colbeck's Overwatch in Michigan were well organized and are catching the cartel in the act. Colbeck has already called for a full forensic audit in Michigan: "The ONLY way that a significant number of Michigan citizens will ever believe yesterday's lawless election results is after completion of a transparent, full forensic audit of the entire election record chain of custody."

As in Michigan, the international election cartel's Minnesota branch is strong. It is operating against the public interest in a coordinated fashion to prevent competition for representative roles. Those representatives are charged not with leading us but rather are responsible for securing our rights in public office. Servants not rulers. The international election cartel also has links peripherally or directly into the Republican Party of Minnesota, the MNGOP. Tony Lazarro is only a small piece of the puzzle. It is not necessary to exhaustively prove the election cartel's precise connections to Minnesota and the MNGOP because by certain patterns of action and inaction the truth is revealed.

Could it be that the MNGOP achieved exactly what it was tasked to do? For example, is it appropriate for the Cicily Davis campaign to have collected and spent well above $1 million only to lose heavily? Where did all that money go? Did Davis or her handlers ever once mention election fraud? When I asked her about it in person, she didn't seem interested.

That the MNGOP is in on it—"it" being the status quo—is not difficult to comprehend, but important to grasp if one is to proceed. It is. (Remember, remember, the paradox of change is fully identifying what is, not what could be or should be.)

The layers of this bio, information, and spiritual war can feel like stumbling through a foggy forest at dusk.

Is it possible we are still learning the language in which to stay spiritually grounded and to stand our physical ground effectively?

Can we even name what we are up against?

Yes.

Global communism.

Consider this historical example: The anti-communists that surrounded Reagan were deceptively named, because they were more accurately anti-Stalinists. In fact, they were Trotskyists. Indeed, they were also communists themselves but in the camp that wanted absolute global communism versus Stalin's communism in one country.

Naming things accurately is one way to hold something to account. Like casting a light-filled charm by spelling and intoning with a certain frequency.

Election integrity became the catch-all term for honest elections. But election integrity was also one of the biggest rackets in the last twenty-four months. It was easy to say one was for it without defining it. Just as it is easy to call oneself a Christian without acting in the spirit of a Christian, without putting any skin in the game.
