# Chapter Six - Recommendations

*"It takes very little talent or creativity to complain about problems.  After all, the people directly impacted by a problem, and eventually those indirectly impacted by the problem, feel the weight and consequences stemming from it.  When I speak in front of an audience, I need not complain at length about the violations of liberty underway in America, because the people know the personal toll exacted by those who corrupt the foundation of self-government.  The audiences come to hear solutions and to commit to action."*

—Captain Seth Keshel, [Veteran Lesson VII: Leaders Create Solutions](https://skeshel.substack.com/p/veteran-lesson-vii-leaders-create) (Ten Lessons for Every Day)


*“Never tell people how to do things.  Tell them what to do and they will surprise you with their ingenuity.”*

It is possible to have actual elections that are not controlled by machines or easily exploited by other means.

The simplest way might be to return to [hand counting paper ballots in small, manageable precincts](https://rumble.com/v15ykkn-precinct-level-voting.html). Local control and oversight. That is easy to understand, and implementable right now. There is no reason for county commissioners to wait for further data to come in. The machines in Minnesota are not in compliance with the latest VVSG 2.0 guidelines and therefore violate our election code, [Minnesota Statute 206.57 Subd.6 Required Certification](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/206.57).

Although I prefer the simplicity and the community involvement (imagine neighbors getting together on election day to count the votes together), but I recognize that hand counting paper is not the only way.

Machines might be used under certain conditions.

Jeffrey O'Donnell says it very well:

"If Americans' votes are to be recorded and counted by machines, every aspect of those machines' operation, configuration, and data must be recorded, immediately available at no cost or administrative burden to citizens and their independent examiners and confirmed 100% accurate through that independent verification. The absence or shortfall of any of those three imperatives (recorded, available, and independently verified) should immediately cause the public to distrust both the purported results from those machines, and also anyone who insists that they accept those results."

Here Jeff describes a possible future where we still use machines but with conditions to increase clarity that the currently less than useless certifications don't have.

Notice, too, that what Jeff prescribes *includes* an audit. That way we don't have to debate whether to have an audit or how to do an audit for 19 months as the 22-month record retention rules loom ever closer.

This approach also jives well with advocates who can't yet stomach the idea of hand counting paper ballots.

But a method to [hand counting paper ballots is viable](https://youtu.be/GBKz1o_VqAE?t=2501) and is described well by Col. Phil Waldron in the Nye County Commission meeting here where the board voted unanimously to move away from electronic voting equipment in their county elections. Waldron's description included a method of using a commercial off the shelf (COTS) camera to take a photo of the front and back of each ballot which would be immediately uploaded to the county website and verifiable by each voter through a unique QR code.

Counties and state legislatures around the country will decide how they want to make elections fair again, and possibly to make every voter's vote count for the first time in decades.

It's possible. It's happening. And it could happen in your county.

Will you help to get it done?

## Small Counties with Great Potential

22 out of 87 Minnesota counties had fewer than 5,700 votes in 2020 and could perhaps more swiftly move to hand tallying, which is already acceptable by law. These counties could be places to find county commissioners more interested in putting an election integrity item on the agenda during county commissioner board meetings, or even making a courageous decision to pass resolutions to remove electronic voting equipment as seen in Nye County, Nevada and Otero County, New Mexico.

| County | Votes |
| --- | --- |
| Big Stone | 2916 |
| Clearwater | 4632 |
| Cook | 3699 |
| Grant | 3569 |
| Jackson | 5693 |
| Kittson | 2552 |
| Lac Qui Parle | 3974 |
| Lake of the Woods | 2375 |
| Lincoln | 3058 |
| Mahnomen | 2254 |
| Marshall | 5016 |
| Murray | 4812 |
| Norman | 3357 |
| Pipestone | 4859 |
| Red Lake | 2145 |
| Rock | 5139 |
| Stevens | 4966 |
| Swift | 5100 |
| Traverse | 1833 |
| Watonwan | 5090 |
| Wilkin | 3354 |
| Yellow Medicine | 5422 |

Skeptics might rightly point out that having fair and transparent elections in such small counties wouldn't change the outcomes of larger statewide elections. But we have to start somewhere to inspire change and to say No to tyranny.

## Objections to Hand Counting

Time and money.

**Time**

In a meeting with election officials and commissioners in Morrison County one objection that was raised was the effort involved in hand tallying.

If additional man power is needed to hand count paper ballots in precinct polling places on election day, [204B.195 TIME OFF FROM WORK TO SERVE AS ELECTION JUDGE](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/204B.195) allows for absence without penalty.

Also, I have met many people who have said they would count the votes for no compensation just so that everyone can regain confidence that the election was conducted fairly and transparently in their precinct and county.

[Minnesota Statute 204C.04 EMPLOYEES; TIME OFF TO VOTE](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/204C/full) in subdivision 1 already provides  the **Right to be Absent** in order to "appear at the employee's polling place, cast a ballot, and return to work on the day of that election, without penalty or deduction from salary or wages because of the absence."

This statute makes mass absentee and mail-in ballots moot.

**Money**

In the same Morrison County meeting, there was concern that the county was already locked into a rather large contract with the software and hardware vendor. That was a sunk cost if they were to switch to hand tallying. Jeremy Pekula made the point that over time hand counting would be much cheaper and welcomed by the community.

## How Much Do Machine Elections Cost?

In earlier chapters we discussed the problems inherent to the ES&S DS200 tabulators that were in use in 65 of 87 Minnesota counties during the 2020 election.

But this was not the only ES&S equipment in play. In 2020, some counties began upgrading to DS450s and DS850s.

![DS450 Pricing Quote Sent to ](ds450_pricing_mcleod.png)

While county commissioners in other states have described these machines as being built in Omaha, Nebraska, both the DS450 and DS850 are made in Germany.

![Assembled in Germany](assembled_in_germany.png)

These newer models are quite expensive.

![Purchase Proposal Quote for McLeod County in 2020](MCCC_DS450_purchase_proposal_quote.png)

Even the Site Support at $4,250 *alone* could be repurposed toward 20 election judges at $20 an hour for 10 hours. Many more election judges could be hired with the $50,000 spent on the DS450 tabulator. Furthermore, if we legislatively removed or dramatically shortened the absentee and early voting periods, absentee ballot board work would be reduced and the election process further simplified.

Meanwhile, Saint Louis County recently purchased [the DS950](https://www.essvote.com/products/ds950/), one of the newest electronic voting machines on the market, likely costing about $250,000.

It's one thing to spend a lot of tax-payer money on vulnerable machines, but another to actually use them correctly. For instance, the [DS200 Operator Guide](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9tgjadp53l7e34o/ES%26S%20DS%20200%20Operator%20Guide.pdf?dl=0) is 222 pages long.

The following two emails between staff at ES&S and the County Elections Administrator in McLeod County demonstrate that there is much vendor hand-holding to maintain and operate these machines.

![](absentee_mcleod_county_1of2.png)

![](absentee_mcleod_county_2of2.png)

Are we asking too much of our election officials at the county level to not only maintain and operate but also mitigate cyber threats to these machines?

## The County Commission Strategy

How can these changes actually happen?

County commissioners have concurrent jurisdiction to govern the overall conduct of elections. Ultimately they must decide whether to use electronic voting equipment to begin with and, if they do, whether to certify local elections run on insecure hardware and software. For the time being, only hand counting paper ballots minimizes fraud to the fullest extent.

In [this video](https://rumble.com/v15yha1-county-commission-strategy.html), David Clements, speaking in Rochester on the first night of the MNGOP state convention (at a separate location), describes the county commissioner strategy. Here's [my take](https://rumble.com/v18ouv9-county-commission-strategy-in-minnesota.html) on the same.

## Resolutions

[By having conversations to raise awareness among your county commissioners](https://youtu.be/KLGl9uGv0kE), you can then work toward drafting and passing resolutions.

In addition to [resolutions that Rick Weible has provided](https://midwestswampwatch.com/mn-actions) on MidwestSwampWatch.com, I want to suggest a few that are focused on machines.

Here are a few areas you could focus on:

1. Remove Machines (epollbooks, tabulators, election management systems)
2. Turn on Cast Vote Records (CVRs) in tabulators and tabulation systems

*The following are not in resolution form, but I will gladly work with anyone to produce formal resolutions.*

**Remove Machines**

Epollbooks (poll pads), tabulators, and election management systems violate 206.57 Subd.6 Required Certification because the EAC has not designated any testing lab to perform its VVSG 2.0 certifications, and 206.57. Subd.6 requires that voting equipment be in compliance with those standards.

**Turn ON Cast Vote Records (CVRs) in tabulators and tabulation systems**

![Pg 57 of the DS200 Operator's Manual](pg57_2.png)

No Minnesotan has yet received cast vote record (CVR) reports from any of the 87 counties in the state, even though these reports represent a key element in the machine audit trail. For instance, a comparison of paper ballots with the cast vote record in a precinct would represent a version of a micro-audit. Notice that this comparison is *different* from what post-election reviews are doing, which is comparing the aggregate vote totals (stored in the election management system database and tabulator tapes) with the hand counted ballots. Jeff Lenberg has shown the [ability to manipulate the database and the tapes to match](https://rumble.com/vgi89t-hacking-democracy-antrim-county-mi-edition.html) while leaving them non-matching with the paper ballots.

Notice that I am focused on the machines. Absentee ballot board balance is important, yes. Removing drop boxes is important, yes. Even with balanced absentee ballot boards, the machines are counting. Even if drop boxes are removed in some areas, mail-in fraud and mule-based fraud will still be simple enough so long as there are *some* drop boxes sprinkled throughout the state. Even if all drop boxes were removed, absentee ballot cheating could still occur. Note that legislation requiring 24-hour surveillance of drop boxes does little to prevent fraud occurring. Once a ballot is in the drop box, it is a legal ballot. See 2000 Mules for proof that 4,000,000 minutes of surveillance footage did next to nothing to preventing ballot traffickers from exploiting this critical weakness in our election system.

Let's get to work.

On June 15, 2022, [David Clements' advice](https://t.me/theprofessorsrecord/7412) was spot on:

"People asking what you can do.  Use a search engine.  Locate your commissioners' email and phone numbers.  Call, write, and show up to your next commission meeting, and support our efforts for transparency.  Likewise, find a contact for the SOS and AG's office and give them hell.  Stop being a spectator."

## Are You a Candidate?

I am calling on all candidates to speak boldly on election issues in public and in conversations with voters while door knocking.

Even better, urge commissioners to remove machines.

Short of that, help them to pass resolutions so that election officials will turn ON cast vote record (CVR) functionality for the primary on Aug 9, which apparently was turned off in at least some counties in 2020. Else you may not be able to trust the result of your election.

A few more considerations:

* Prepare to challenge results of elections
* Spend a little less than normal on marketing
* Save cash to pay for a [discretionary audit](https://www.sos.state.mn.us/elections-voting/how-elections-work/recounts/) for the primary and midterms
* Join fellow citizens at county commissioner meetings (record it and share it with your supporters to inspire them to do the same)

We are in uncharted waters.

These times are not normal.

The primaries are fast approaching. We cannot say "we will get them next time" - this is our time.

## Use Your Platform

![SOS candidate in New Mexico asking commissioners not to certify until conditions are met](audrey_trujillo.png)

I will make similar requests to Trujillo of our commissioners across the state. If you know a commissioner, please let them know. If you are commissioner reading this, thank you. We are already in territory (in other states, like New Mexico) where county commissioners are being put to the test. Are you going to certify your county's primary election on August 9 if it was run on machines that aren't certified according to the latest VVSG 2.0 standards, which may put that equipment in violation of Minnesota Statute 206.57 Subd.6 Required Certification? How about on November 8?

I am also calling for all America First Candidates to make speaking about the election machines a priority. If you don't think machines can alter elections, look at Kandiss Taylor's gubernatorial result in the Georgia primaries. She had 60,000 volunteers but somehow only received 40,000 votes. That's the power of an algorithm to swap votes.

When you're evaluating candidates, consider: If candidates are not speaking about election machines, why aren't they?

## Do You Have A Few Minutes Per Day?

Jeffrey O'Donnell recently wrote on his Telegram channel: "Every byte of data we get now is a byte they cannot truly destroy in September. Don't lose sight of that."

![Data Request from Hennepin County](foia_submit.png)

Jeff has provided a [general guide to FOIA requests](https://magaraccoon.com/foia.html).

I also share more about FOIA possibilities on the [Erik for SOS channel](https://t.me/erikmn).

## Vote in Person in the Primary and Midterm Elections

The Primary Election is on August 9, 2022.

It is important that republicans (and anyone planning to vote for republican candidates) who are supporting America First candidates vote in person on election day, as late in the day as possible.

Even if you join the queue five minutes before polls closed, you are legally allowed to vote, even if the line is very long. The polling place will post someone in the line marking the end of the line at the deadline. Everyone in front of that person already at the polling location in their precinct should be allowed to vote.

Why vote in person late in the day?

Because we now have reason to believe that there are centralized mechanisms that through a combination of the statewide voter registration system, the epollbooks, and the scanned barcode when absentee ballots are delivered which allow the powers that be to see the full landscape of who has voted and who has not.

If the vast majority of republican voters vote very late in the day, say at 5pm or later, then it becomes increasingly difficult to cheat using illegitimate absentee ballots. (I use the word illegitimate because by statute once a ballot enters the system it is by definition legal.)

Therefore, I am urging republican voters *not* to take the convenient option and vote through absentee or early voting.

If you are in a mail-in ballot precinct, you have the option to deliver your mail-in ballot directly to the county clerk up until 3pm on election day (according to [Minnesota Statute 203B.08](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/203B.08)).

Are you an event planner? Imagine holding a post-election party for republicans nearby the polling place to gather after voting in person to encourage reluctant in-person republican voters to take this small action step for election integrity.

Of course, voting in person doesn't prevent tabulator vote-swapping or server-based tampering, but it does force those attempting to subvert our elections to resort to electronic methods at greater scale, which is risky.

Finally, considering sharing [this book](https://leanpub.com/sim2020) with your elected officials, candidates, and county commissioners to provide context on the depth of the problem we're facing, and what they can do about it.
