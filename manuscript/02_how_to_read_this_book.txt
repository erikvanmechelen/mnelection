# How to Read this Book

Even while comprehension of the election process is vital to any citizen's civic involvement, acquiring such understanding can be tedious. 

As such, the flow information is interrupted with anecdotes, stories, and vignettes from various places I visited inside and beyond Minnesota's borders. In a musical phrase these forays would sound dissonant, but with the dryness of these topics my hope instead is for the narratives to carry a tonic tone which readies the reader for the next comparatively difficult passage.

It can be helpful to consider that in large parts what is being dissected is a crime scene for which the author and the reader have only limited access. But enough light from multiple angles of approach—as is sought by initiatives such as Capt. Seth Keshel's Four Core or by Professor David Clements' County Commissioner Strategy—brings what is hidden in darkness to clearer view. Once we fully identify where we are, change is suddenly possible. 

The book is separated into three sections.
