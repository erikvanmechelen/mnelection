# Chapter Four - Defense

*“Since we know what we will find when we do our audits—”*

*“That we’ve been duped.”*

*“Yes, so what’s stopping us from reformulating our election processes as you described earlier and then immediately calling for new elections?”*

*“Nothing.”*

—From a conversation between Col. Phil Waldren and the author inside The Military Heritage Alliance around 6pm on Day Three of Mike Lindell’s Cyber Symposium in Sioux Falls, South Dakota on August 12, 2021

***

The Defense Phase is where the attackers try to defend against what Patrick Colbeck calls the meddling kids from discovering what they did. It involves cover ups, destruction of physical and digitial evidence (Dominion's Trusted Build), slow walking and infiltration of livestreamed election audits (the Maricopa audit), media bullying, and lawfare.

This phase began on election night 2020 (and before that) and it is where we are in June 2022 as this book goes to the press.

Some object to the prospect of coordinated fraud on the grounds that it would not be so easy to cover up.

But if there were people smart enough, sophisticated enough, and resourceful enough to pull off such a heist nationally (and likely involving international components), don't you think they would have some kind of plan to get away with it? They did, although in retrospect it was a bit sloppy. And fortunately there were eyes on their actions. People like Patrick Colbeck, author of *The 2020 Coup*, were on the scene at the TCF center in Detroit serving as a certified Poll Challenger. And people like Jeffrey O'Donnell and so many others have joined the fight since.

The people that did this may be clever, but it was an uphill task to pull every lever and not spring a leak.

The first leak was on election night when there was [a coordinated pause to vote counting](https://www.mixonium.com/public/post/11555) in multiple states.

That alerted millions if not tens of millions to the coup right from the start. It was only a matter of time before the riddle could be solved, despite extensive interference from many you might have thought would have supported election accuracy and transparency, but who have revealed that they do not.

## Part of Their Plan?

At the Cyber Symposium, Dr. Shiva gave a presentation which detailed the connections between the various players and mentioned a few of their published playbooks. One of these was [The Long Fuse](https://projectapario.com/Browse?document=WJT9LCRAJ&filename=EIP-Final-Report.pdf), by the Election Integrity Partnership.

On page 3, the 'Data Cleanup' phase immediately follows the election. What data exactly needed to be cleaned up?

![Part of the plan](data_cleanup.png)

Part of the data cleanup being done would need to happen with the voter rolls. Public requests of these rolls and comparisons between them show large changes across time in registrations. Presumably this could cover up large additions of phantom voters just prior to elections.

But what is harder to cover up is detailed comparisons across counties in a single state, as was shown by Erin Clements in New Mexico's voter rolls, or the proof of database manipulation in the Mesa County, Colorado Dominion Trusted Build.

![image of 12 counties with same graph](...)

Here's Hoang Quan on the Trusted Build:

Which by the way should be technically deficient, because it invalidates the 22-month rule for retention of election records. If you can't audit, review, why have the 22-month retention period (or longer, depending upon state statutes of retention of election records).

## 700,000 Reported Absentee Voters Not Connected in SVRS

[Rick Weible's database analysis](https://midwestswampwatch.com) of Minnesota's statewide voter registration system (SVRS) highlighted that there were more than 700,000 absentee voters reported than documented in the SVRS five days *after* the MN Canvassing Board certified the election.

In a June 7, 2022 GGP meeting in Dakota County, election official Andy Lokken said that after the fact comparative analysis of SOS-reported data with the SVRS data was not an effective way to verify results.

![EDIT ADD ANDY LOKKEN VIDEO ON SAME](find on Dropbox upload)

Then how *should* an election be verified by the people?

Bear in mind that no statewide nor any county-wide full forensic audits (of all election materials, not a recount of ballots) has been done in Minnesota. Citizens have faced considerable resistance from those responsible for ensuring that no voter is disenfranchised and have succeeded in finding numerous indicators and proof that election processes were not followed according to statute and that the results are therefore seriously in question.

Regarding the absentee voters: If the SOS data was not at all consistent with the SVRS data 25 days *after* the November 3, 2020 election, *when* was it going to be? And how did the MN State Canvassing Board certify the election 5 days prior with such a large discrepancy? To repeat, on November 29, 2020, just 5 days after the MN Canvassing Board certified the election, more than 700,000 reported absentee voters were not connected in the statewide voter registration system.

This fact alone should have triggered a statewide audit and uproar from any elected officials that care about election integrity. If you are unsure about your local elected officials, ask them what they think about this issue and whether they believe we ought to have higher standards for our absentee ballot process as it pertains to data accuracy in our statewide voter registration system.

From the perspective of the defense phase relating to absentee ballot coverup, deflection and obfuscation of this fact (it still remains unresolved) should be expected—the general public learning this certainly threatens to undermine the credibility of those at the helm.

## Minnesota Post Election Review Reveals Missing Ballots

The local media likes to report on the success of risk-limiting audits (RLAs), recounts, and post-election reviews. Let's discuss why these are not suitable to demonstrate the total accuracy and integrity of a machine-driven election.

In Minnesota only about 3% of of precincts per county are subject to a post-election review according to [Minnesota Statute 206.89 POSTELECTION REVIEW OF VOTING SYSTEMS](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/206.89).

A [post election review](https://www.sos.state.mn.us/elections-voting/how-elections-work/post-election-reviews/) hand counts ballots returned by the optical scan ballot counters in select precincts. (These are sometimes referred to as risk-limiting audits, although how much risk do they truly mitigate?)

![863 votes not explained but considered ACCEPTABLE](precinct_4950.png)

In a postelection review in Dakota County's Precinct 4950, WEST ST PAUL W-2 P-2, the total unadjusted difference was 870 votes. 7 of those 870 votes were explained, but 863 were not explained. Why then does the total adjusted difference (the last column) show all zeros? The total adjusted difference should read 863 (870 minus 7). Even with 65% (863 out of 1327) of the total votes in this postelection review left unexplained, the Final Results row says this is a "Difference of not more than 0.5%" and the Total Adjusted Difference is "0%", deemed "ACCEPTABLE".

Of course, this is clearly **not** acceptable and it begs the question: How many more precincts would turn up red flags like this if more postelection reviews had been done? And how many more red flags might be raised if proper audits were done? Is this why cast vote records (CVRs) have not been forthcoming from local election officials? With this work being shown to Minnesotans, it would be strange if they were not asking for audits and accountability.

What this example demonstrates even more is the difficulty of reconciling the paper ballots to the machine counts. If a top-down simulation is being run that needs to be backfilled after the fact with ballot (or printer) deliveries to precincts and counties 2000-Mules style, but that last-minute work isn't completed, then the outcome would be what we've seen in Dakota County's Precinct 4950.

What's more, by comparing the increases to Trump votes (from hand count to total votes) with the increases to Biden votes (from hand count to total votes), we also gain insight into how an weighted ratio algorithm might have been used to increase Biden votes by almost 269% while Trump votes only increased by 95%.

You be the judge. Was this data cleaned up well?

When Kim Bauer received in June 2022 the receipts from post-election reviews done in Dakota County for 2020 as well as 2021 (when her school board election took place), it was discovered that some of the post-election review documentation differed from the originals.

## A Petition to Stop the Certification of Minnesota's Election

Based on the postelection review above (but not only that) it was correct for [Susan Shogren Smith](https://shogrensmithlaw.com/about-us) to properly serve [a petition](https://erikvanmechelen.substack.com/p/should-minnesotas-2020-election-have) to each member of the Minnesota State Canvassing Board prior to its certification of the 2020 election, in part reading:

"Minnesota candidates for office and voters have come forward with affadavits detailing concerns and observations about the ignored and failed election processes in counties across the state...If this Court does not take action to prevent the certification of the Minnesota election until a complete, bi-partisan statewide audit of the election occurs, including election materials, our election system, and the trust of the voters, will be irreparably harmed."

The MN State Canvassing Board is the sole entity identified in the MN Constitution carrying the duty to canvass the statewide election results. However, the MN Supreme Court erroneously ruled (in my opinion) that all 87 counties had to be served. Therefore [the case was dismissed](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20420161-order-minnesota-supreme-court-dismisses-gop-election-contest) without a hearing on the facts on Friday afternoon, December 4, 2020. This dismissal was critical to meeting the the safe harbor deadline of December 8, 2020.

Since that time, every point made in the petition has been confirmed by the work of Rick Weible and others, including "issues related to procedure, observer and election judge access, voter intimidation, lost ballots, lost absentee envelopes, missing election materials and questionable ballots... [and] concerns about voting equipment transmitting results during the early counting period on election day."

## Crow Wing County

![Crow Wing Commissioners and County Attorney](crow_wing_commissioners.jpg)

After multiple commissioner board meetings attended by dozens of Minnesotans who didn't trust the results of the 2020 election, the commissioners were finally persuaded in late December to pass a resolution seeking an audit. Don Ryan, the County Attorney, interpreted Minnesota law and advised that the county could not unseal its own ballots, and so the request was made to Secretary of State Steve Simon, who declined to undertake a full forensic audit of all election material and data.

In their resolution, which passed 4-1, the commissioners stated that the board "continues to have faith in the 2020 election results as valid and reliable but it is equally troubling that there are citizens who still have a sincerely held belief that it was not", suggesting they did not wholeheartedly agree with their constituents and were perhaps going ahead with the resolution as a matter of appeasement. In May 2022, at least one of the same commissioners [was afraid to open an email](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7E3qCA_3k) with a link to 2000 Mules when candidate for house rep Doug Kern sent it to the Board.

“Our office will not engage in a vague and impossibly broad search for unspecified misconduct based on anyone’s gut feeling, hunch, or belief — no matter how sincerely held,” Simon said. “The 2020 general election, which took place almost 15 months ago, was fundamentally fair, accurate, honest, and secure across Minnesota.”

![Secretary of State Simon's response, page 1 of 2](OSS_response_1.png)

![Secretary of State Simon's response, page 2 of 2](OSS_response_2.png)

If the Secretary of State *had* complied with the commissioners' request, election materials and machines may have been audited. This would have been a proper audit instead of a post election review or a recount which simply audits the *results*.

Why should the machines and data be audited? Because, as was shown by Jeff Lensburg in the Antrim County, Michigan case, [votes can easily be swapped](https://rumble.com/vgi89t-hacking-democracy-antrim-county-mi-edition.html) which would not be identified in a canvass, postelection review, or risk-limiting audit (recount).

However, if the machines and full chain of custody—of both materials and data— were to be audited, the vulnerabilities described in earlier chapters could be exposed.

Secretary of State Steve Simon made this decision in January, 2022, missing an opportunity to demonstrate transparency in Minnesota's election process and systems.

Since then, an even faster method to verify whether the paper ballots match the machine count (as scanned through the tabulators) has been identified.

## Dakota County

When the people with Rick Weible's help found indications that the results Dakota County announced for Kim Bauer's 2021 School Board race in ISD 196 may not have been accurate, they began requesting information from the county to try to reconcile the mismatching information.

To this day, the data in the statewide voter registration system and the reported results from the county and the reported results from the school district have not been reconciled.

In May I sat in a closed door meeting where the county election officials tried to explain what they thought happened but were unable to satisfyingly do so. This meeting in particular gave me insight into the depth of the problem we face, since it is my opinion that some election officials simply do not understand the technical details of the software and hardware, whereas others may very well understand but be held back from helping us by some as yet to be discovered reason. In that particular meeting also was the election official's boss, who tried to steer the meeting. He previously had said I could not record the county commissioner meetings, when of course I could (and did) seeing as they are open meetings.

On June 7, 2022, [Rick Weible spoke to Dakota County about their software](https://rumble.com/v1998gh-rick-weible-informs-dakota-county-about-their-software.html), recommending they return to hand counting and hand tallying.

That day, the county commissioners voted favorably on not approving drop box voting and returning to party balance on absentee ballot boards while Andy Lokken described [Minnesota's unique situation](https://youtu.be/mE1e3XGf7xM), which is "so unique that it creates delays in getting software here."

There is more work to do since Dakota County (and every county in Minnesota) still uses the modern electronic voting systems which are highly vulnerable to subversion.

## Wright County

The teams in Wright County were successful in convincing the county commissioners there to hold [a workshop dedicated to election integrity](https://rumble.com/v157g8v-rick-weible-in-wright-county-may-17-2022.html) with Rick Weible as the speaker, on May 17, 2022.

At the close of this meeting, it was decided that a joint task force would be put in place involving county commissioners, election officials, and members of the public.

## Morrison County

After Jeremy Pekula went on the radio asking whether the county commissioners were going to take action, he received another invitation to meet.

In mid May, after speaking on the radio alongside Jeremy in the morning, we met that afternoon with the County Administrator, two county commissioners, the head election official, and the deputy election official.

We shared some of the information already discussed in this book.

We asked whether they would like to have an item on the agenda in a forthcoming county commmissioners meeting.

So far they have not agreed to do so.

## Sherburne County

Teri Dickinson was very effective in organizing people to attend county commissioner meetings in Sherburne County. She even once gave up her precious speaking slot to give me three minutes to anchor a slate of speakers including Kari Watkins, who that day shared details from the Halderman report. I stressed the opportunity for the commissioners to take in all the information and find it in themselves to make history by removing the machines.

The Sherburne county commissioners refused to (so far) have a public hearing or agenda item during the county commissioner board meeting despite multiple weeks of open forum comments [like Rick Weible's here](https://rumble.com/v15hs5h-voting-improvements-sherburne-county-may-3-2022.html) sharing critical vulnerabilities with Sherburne's modern electronic voting equipment. This inability to listen or disinterest in the facts led Kari Watkins to step up and run for county commissioner herself.

Because of this roadblock, the action teams pivoted to meetings with the townships.

A Haven Township meeting on June 20, 2022 started out with the usual disappointments and interference. Instead of Rick Weible's presentation starting the 7 p.m. meeting, as had been promised, he and those attending who had travelled to attend were made to wait until almost 9 p.m. once other items at the supervisor's meeting had been completed. Rick was then offered 10 minutes. After negotiation, he was given around 40 minutes, with the supervisor's interjecting with questions.

The meeting was then adjourned after the Chair said her eyes were glazing over, but three of the supervisor's stayed around to hear more of Rick's presentation, which went about another hour.

By the end, one of the supervisors said to me walking out of the building, "If we don't get to hand count here, I'm not going to certify the election," refering to the primary on August 9.

This was music to my ears.

## Where Are the Cast Vote Records?

Cast vote records (CVR) allow the machines to tell on themselves. Without them, the machine audit trail is severely limited.

![Pima County Cast Vote Records](cvr_honest.png)

Have a look at this CVR from Pima County.

The top two graphs look good.

But the third (bottom) CVR is not realistic. The only way that could happen is if there happened to be several thousand Biden ballots show up at the same time. Then you might see that driving toward the setpoint. But this graph clearly shows a defiance of the law of large numbers.

To date no CVR reports have been shared with the public despite numerous public data requests to county election officials and their offices throughout the state.

Here's just one response from the Todd County Attorney:

!["Todd County does not create this data"](todd_county_atty_opinion.png)

But ES&S's own manuals describe the availability of this functionality.

![CVR described by ES&S](cvr.png)

I even sent the Todd County election officials a PDF of how to extract the CVRs, which are page 42 of the ES&S Electionware Volume V: Results User's Guide.

![Sample Export of CVR](CVR_export.png)

![How to export the CVR](sample_cvr.png)

No response was given to the following email since I sent it on April 29, 2022.

![Email providing directions to extract the CVR](todd_county_cvr.png)

I have tried to sort out how CVRs might have been turned off, or if there is a language game being played, or if the CVRs might be stored somewhere else or called something else.

[From a document](https://edca.1dca.org/DcaDocs/2020/2445/2020-2445_Brief_1050162_RC14B202D20Supplemental2FAmended20Appendix.pdf) titled "Ballot Image Information on ES&S Systems issued November 1, 2018, it appears that the EVS Electionware user can specify which ballot images are to be saved on the DS200 and Central Scanners (DS450/DS850): 1) All images, 2) Write-In Images Only, 3) No images. Could these configurations at all be related to whether the CVRs are saved?

The technical details may not be clear, but the truth is states like Rhode Island and select counties in other states *have* received their CVRs which exposed the machine problem. Minnesota is using the same hardware and software from the same vendors as these other states.

But in Minnesota we apparently don't have CVRs, at least according to the responses Minnesotans have so far received from their county officials.

On June 24, 2022 I spoke on the phone with the county auditor in Chisago County to learn more about why they don't have the CVRs. [In this phone call](https://soundcloud.com/erikvanmech/chisago-hart-upgrademp3), the county auditor shared that Hart had done an onsite software upgrade about a month prior (around May 2022) which archived the 2020 election. I'm not sure whether this is in violation of [the 52 USC §20701 22-month election data retention records](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title52-section20701&num=0&edition=prelim).

The bottom line is that those digital election records must be kept according to federal law for 22 months. On the phone call, the county auditor of Chisago County stated that she had already asked the vendor who said they could not be recovered. To her credit, the Chisago County Auditor stated that she had made a note to save that report in upcoming elections, to which I expressed gratitude.

Going forward, it is also important to urge county commissioners to pass resolutions (in county commission meetings) so that election officials will turn ON cast vote record (CVR) functionality (if indeed the CVR functionality has been turned OFF) for the primary on Aug 9, 2022. If they were turned off in at least some counties in 2020, they should be turned back on.

*Dominion and Hart also produced CVRs. In Hart's case, it produces a CVR (basic to counting ballots and their vote opportunities):  Out of Idaho a Technical Reference Manual ["Ballot Scanning and Review Software"](https://sos.idaho.gov/elect/clerk/hart/verity/Verity_Central_Technical_Reference_Manual_6600-003_A04.pdf) Terms: Cast Vote Record (pages 10, 11, 14, and 189); CVR (pages 10, 11, 14, 18, 163, 164, 214) and 131, 133, 135) ...*

## Pushing Back Against Tyranny

On Day 2 of the Cyber Symposium I found a chair near the front, stage left, where Dr. Frank and Mark Cook continued to explore and explain the server images provided by Tina Peters (highlighted in the [S]election Code documentary). I had noticed [Captain Seth Keshel](https://captk.com) come in and wanted to speak with him. Not long before this Code Monkey's lawyer had apparently suggested they not examine the server images since they may have been acquired illegally (untrue, as it is the duty of county clerks to preserve election materials and data). I learned from the person who gave me a ride from Minneapolis that a few of them in the back were looking at the same server images and feeding Dr. Frank and Mark Cook information. Dr. Frank's calming intonation, "This is *better* than PCAPs" still holds true today.

When Seth finished speaking with Wendy Rogers and Sunny Borrelli, I introduced myself. He said to focus on the collar counties around the Twin Cities like Wright, Scott, etc. Seth's point was that we would face too much opposition in counties like Hennepin, Ramsey, Dakota, or St. Louis. And given the progress teams have made in places like Wright and Dakota, his trend and political analysis was not wrong to highlight them. But as time passed it was clear that breakthroughs might also be achieved in more rural, lower population counties, of which there are many across our 87-county state.

Months later, my friend Nathan and I had been thinking about where to focus in Minnesota. Nathan said, Why not Todd County? David Clements had been urging folks to find rural counties where county commissioners might be more willing to put election discussions on the agenda or even pass favorable resolutions. And, after all, Dr. Frank's refrain is "Vote Amish," a nod to elections without unneeded technology. Todd County is one of the Amish hotspots in Minnesota. So I sent Todd County a data request for their 2020 cast vote record (CVR) report on the same day I sent a request for one from Hennepin County.

I tell this story in wrapping up the chapter on the enemy's coverup to illustrate a lesson encapsulated by Stargate SG-1's Season 5, Episode 5 - Red Sky, wherein the SG-1 team causes the disruption of a sun near a planet protected by the Asgard. Unbeknownst to the locals, SG-1 seeks help from the 'Grand Council' Asgard. In the conclusion, it is unclear whether the solution attempted by the SG-1 team and the local population was successful, or if the Asgard had helped them out after all.

In other words, it's important to try. God takes care of the results in time.

And wouldn't you know it? Within moments of writing the above lines (Thursday, June 16, 2022) I stumbled upon the following page in the ES&S DS200 Operator's Manual, which resolves much of the confusion I'd had up to this point regarding cast vote records (CVR) and the seeming *lack* of any in Minnesota from the 2020 election.

Page 57 of the [ES&S Operator's Manual](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ej4d6c51knlv3u4/ES%26S%20DS%20200%20Operator%20Guide%20copy%202.pdf?dl=0) explains how if the ballot images are turned off, **so are the cast vote records**. I was so excited to find this that I immediately posted the following on [my Telegram channel](https://t.me/erikmn).

![Pg 57 of the ES&S DS200 Operator's Manual](pg57.png)

This means that even if we *keep* the machines for the upcoming primary elections on August 9, 2022, county commissioners could pass resolutions to turn ON the cast vote records so that there is a machine trail. There is no logical push back to *not* having these ON. Our tax dollars have paid for these machines and how they count the votes should be auditable and transparent.

If cast vote records are turned ON, then candidates and the public can request the cast vote records immediatly after the primary election to verify the reported results match the machine results. If they are denied these, it should only raise further suspicion about what might be being covered up.

***

Even with the defense phase (cover up and destruction of evidence) of the election coup falling apart, so far no county commissions (in Minnesota) have decided to return to hand counting paper ballots as many of their constituents desire—instead, counties plan to run elections on very similar if not the same software which managed the 2020 election. This would be unwise if fair and transparent elections are desired.

I fully support the many people continuing to go to their county commissioner board meetings to inform them of available fixes to restore trust to all voters.

## Then vs. Now

I want to close this chapter with a summary from Jeffrey O'Donnell posted on June 1, 2022, contrasting the August 2021 position with the June 2022 position.

The rest of this chapter are Jeff's words from [this post](https://t.me/ALoneRaccoon/2221):

I joined this fight full time more than nine months ago. I wilfully pushed the pause button on our lives and trusted God to provide - and he has. I have a new appreciation for the Israelites who were given manna to survive - each day's needs are supplied. The next week or month... that's where faith and trust come in. At that time, Lindell's symposium had just happened and everyone thought the pcap information would save us. We were wrong. Specifically speaking,

* the process of defining the algorithms used to sway the election was still in its infancy, with Ed Solomon and Draza Smith only just starting to be able to describe the process

* State voter rolls were being only cursorily examined, and little comparison was being done between states

* The inner workings of the election servers was still a complete mystery

* Most analysis of the 2020 fraud was being done by people within counties. Very little information was being shared between states or even counties

* The clues to the whole thing in the Edison election night reporting were seen but not yet understood

* No effort existed to collect, analyze, and share election data such as cast vote records and ballot images. The importance of Cast Vote Records in this fight was really not recognized yet.

* Although "phantom" absentee votes were suspected, their prevalence and widespread abuse was not generally known yet.

* Protecting 2022/2024, while on people's radar, had no viable plan."

Now look at today.

* the algorithm used by the election servers is well understood and can even be predicted now

* Tremendous problems with voter rolls have been loudly documented in many states.

* We have a full understanding of the internal working of the Dominion system, with other vendors soon to come.

* There is coordination and cooperation - and healthy competition - between groups in different states

* Edison has been revealed to be a conspirator in the election plot, and while much is still not understood, the "edison zero" and the flipping of votes between absentee and in-person has been well-documented, as has the fact that the reporting is largely theater and does not match up well with the actual results in a state/county until the very end,

* Cast Vote Records, ballot images, tabulator logs, voter rolls/histories and more have been obtained from many counties in many states, and their analysis has proved crucial. Any bit of data we get from a county is something they cannot destroy in September.

* Massive absentee ballot fraud is a fact.

* Findings from 2020 are being used in many ways to minimize the fraud potential in future elections... plus the identification of any fraud now takes minutes rather than months.

* Serious court cases (much better than the quick ones done right after the election) are progressing in numerous states"

Where are the arrests? Please do not be naïve. We are forced to be a citizen's Justice Department, because our country does not currently have a functioning one. Our burden of proof is immense and unfair. We have no subpeona or warrant power. You need to think of this for what it is - a national RICO case. Read how Guliani broke up the mobs in New York. He built his case from the ground up and quietly climbed the ladder of corruption until he had the goods on ALL the bosses. Then he struck.
