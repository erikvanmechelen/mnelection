then i learned it was possible to configure DS200s to act like Model 100s (a previous version of the tabulator) which does not include a CVR.

why buy the new versions and then use the *old* configurations? who made this decision?



# Chapter Two - Machines

“There’s no way we can ever trust a computer system built with components made overseas, particularly in China, or assembled in China, let alone both, and that’s what we have in our voting system, unfortunately.”

*Col. Shawn Smith, USAF, Ret. – 25 year Air Force veteran and the former director and test manager for the operational testing of complex, computer-based weapon systems and a subject matter expert on the security of computer-based election systems, calling in to a Tarrant County, Texas meeting*

##A History
In the first place, how did we get to using machines, and *electronic* voting machines, in elections?

Before voting machines, voting was often done by voice throughout the 1800s. Kentucky used voice voting until 1891. The first paper ballots arrive in the early 19th century.

Then came voting machines: first lever, then punch cards.

Lever voting machines have been around a long time.

![Drawing of Voting Machine](1votingmachine.jpg)

Here’s a physical example:

![Lever Voting Machine](2votingmachine.jpg)

Punch card systems were developed in the 1960s and were last used in two Idaho counties in 2014, on [the Votomatic](https://verifiedvoting.org/election-system/ess-votomatic/) provided by ES&S.

![Punch Card System](3votingmachine.jpg)

Fast forward to the 2000 presidential election between Al Gore and George W. Bush. Hanging chads on Sequoia Voting Systems punch-card voting system led to a recount, which Bush won.

![Hanging Chads](4votingmachine.jpg)

Sequoia Voting Systems got its start in the 1970s as Mathematical Systems Corporation of Anaheim, California, offering an alternative to ES&S’s Votomatic punch cards. On March 8, 2005 Smartmatic Corp. (a Venezuelan company) acquired Sequoia. This raised eyebrows since Smartmatic had only the previous year been selected to by the Chavez-era Venezuelan government to provide voting systems for the presidential recall election, it’s [first time providing machines](https://ia801704.us.archive.org/34/items/smartmatic-sequoia-and-venezuela/Smartmatic%20Sequoia%20and%20Venezuela.pdf) for an election. As of June 4, 2010 it’s parent company was Dominion Voting Systems.

According to Sequoia’s own employees, Sequoia may have [been responsible](https://web.archive.org/web/20070928013625/http://www.votetrustusa.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2560&Itemid=51) for the defective punch cards in Florida which led to “hanging chads” or undervotes to the tune of 10,000 in Palm Beach County.

One of Sequoia’s workers [told](https://web.archive.org/web/20070928013625/http://www.votetrustusa.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2560&Itemid=51) Dan Rather:

“My own personal opinion was the touch screen voting system wasn't getting off the ground like that they—like they would hope. And because they weren't having any problems with paper ballots. So, I feel like they—deliberately did all this to have problems with the paper ballots so the electronically voting systems would get off the ground—and which it did in a big way.”

Specifically, USC 52 Ch. 209 Subchapter I—PAYMENTS TO STATES FOR ELECTION ADMINISTRATION IMPROVEMENTS AND REPLACEMENT OF PUNCH CARD AND LEVER VOTING MACHINES. §20902 states: Replacement of punch card or lever voting machines.

Sequoia benefitted from the passage of federal legislation in 2002—[the Help America Vote Act of 2002](https://www.justice.gov/crt/help-america-vote-act-2002)—because *they manufactured electronic voting equipment*.

In 2003 Beverly Harris found Diebold’s source code on the internet. Diebold had only entered the elections business a year prior through its purchase of Global Elections Systems, a touch-screen voting technology producer in Texas. The source code revealed that Diebold voting systems used an unsecured access database, meaning anyone could access, change data, and erase logs.

In 2007 Diebold Election Systems rebranded as Premier Election Solutions and in 2009 they sold to Election Systems & Software (ES&S), which by 2014 was the largest manufacturer of United States voting machines.

The [Source Code Review of the Diebold Voting System](https://jhalderm.com/pub/papers/diebold-ttbr07.pdf) was published by 6 authors on July 20, 2007, showed the system was 1) vulnerable to malicious software, 2) susceptible to viruses, 3) failed to protect ballot secrecy, and 4) vulnerable to malicious insiders.

More recently, one of the authors of the Diebold review, J. Alex Halderman of Princeton University, provided [the Halderman Declaration](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21038844-20210802-expert-rebuttal-declaration-of-j-alex-halderman) on Georgia’s ballot marking devices (BMD). Halderman has also issued a sealed [25,000-word report](https://libertysword.com/expert-hackers-25000-word-secret-report-threatens-to-uncover-georgias-real-election) on voting systems vulnerabilities.

In an emergency meeting in Otero County, New Mexico in May 2022, nation-state vulnerability expert Jeff Lensberg further detailed vulnerabilities.

##Putting the History in Context

The history of voting machines spans over 100 years. However the use of electronic voting machines is very short, only two to three decades. During almost the entirety of that duration, the electronic systems have been shown to be insecure, hackable, and manipulable, sometimes if not often by design.

Their lack of certifications is further troubling.

Col. Shawn Smith, in the Tarrant County, TX meeting in the first half of 2022:

“…And for the people who said well, the machines are certified, I would say, the space shuttle Columbia was also certified for flight. How’d that turn out? The Boeing 737 Max was certified for passenger operations, and then crashed killing over 500 people in two separate accidents before they finally let experts take a look at it. And my point in saying that is not to try to scare people, but just to say that based on my experience, and I’m not a cyber professional, but I work with cyber pros, and I know the difference between somebody who knows cyber and somebody who doesn’t. And if you don’t know the difference, then you’re in very dangerous territory when you try to make any conclusions or try to listen to someone who doesn’t really know what they’re talking about.

“Our voting systems from my perspective based on the expert examiner’s report, cannot be trusted with our election. And what they require in order to for you to verify for yourself is that you become a cyber expert. Otherwise, you’re forced to trust other people who say they’re experts, people who have conflicts of interest, and people who’ve been trained essentially by the National Association of Secretaries of State, the election directors, and the Election Assistance Commission…”

###Certifications Are Less Than Useless

Throughout its [certification process](https://www.eac.gov/voting-equipment/system-certification-process), the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) which was established by [the Help America Vote Act](https://www.eac.gov/about_the_eac/help_america_vote_act.aspx) (2002) has not certified about 95% of Minnesota counties.

Those county’s electronic voting equipment are merely certified by the Minnesota Secretary of State. The few counties that are EAC certified have the problem indicated by Col. Shawn Smith, that those certifications provide the illusion of security when in fact those systems are anything but ready to run secure elections.

Let's take a look at the certification maps. Note that being certified or not certified doesn’t guarantee system security, as we shall discuss shortly.

In the following image, Red = Certified | White = Not Certified

![USA EAC Certification Map](cert_map1.png)

If we zoom in on Minnesota, we find that only 6 of 87 counties have voting equipment that is certified by the EAC. Remember, red counties are certified, white are not certified.

![MN EAC Certification Map](certmap2.png)

Here are the counties in Minnesota that are certified by the EAC:

![County EAC Certifications](certmap3.png)

Thinking that this felt off, I called the EAC and left a voicemail and sent a question by email, which was replied to the same day (04/20/2022).

![EAC email reply](certmap4.png)

This may have been comforting if not for a close reading of Minnesota election law.

[Minnesota Statute 206.57, Subd.6](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/206.57) states in full:

Subd. 6.Required certification.

In addition to the requirements in subdivision 1, a voting system must be certified by an independent testing authority accredited by the Election Assistance Commission or appropriate federal agency responsible for testing and certification of compliance with the federal voting systems guidelines at the time of submission of the application required by subdivision 1 to be in conformity with voluntary voting system guidelines issued by the Election Assistance Commission or other previously referenced agency. The application must be accompanied by the certification report of the voting systems test laboratory. A certification under this section from an independent testing authority accredited by the Election Assistance Commission or other previously referenced agency meets the requirement of Minnesota Rules, part [8220.0350](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/rules/8220.0350/), item L. A vendor must provide a copy of the source code for the voting system to the secretary of state. A chair of a major political party or the secretary of state may select, in consultation with the vendor, an independent third-party evaluator to examine the source code to ensure that it functions as represented by the vendor and that the code is free from defects. A major political party that elects to have the source code examined must pay for the examination. Except as provided by this subdivision, a source code that is trade secret information must be treated as nonpublic information, according to [section 13.37](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/13.37). A third-party evaluator must not disclose the source code to anyone else.

It is important to note that as of now there are no other appropriate federal agencies outside of the Election Assistance Commission (EAC), which itself authorizes Pro V&V and SLI Compliance.

Are There Limits to Certifications from the EAC?

Let’s take a look at the [EAC certification for Dominion 4.14-E](https://www.dropbox.com/s/b0efp9zqshzj1cm/EAC%20Report_DVS4.14E_FinalCert_FINAL_7.2.15.pdf?dl=0).

![EAC Certification for Dominion 4.14-E](certmap5.png)

On [page 1](https://www.dropbox.com/s/b0efp9zqshzj1cm/EAC%20Report_DVS4.14E_FinalCert_FINAL_7.2.15.pdf?dl=0) note the last sentence:

“This certificate is not an endorsement of the product by any agency of the U.S. Government and no warranty of the product is either expressed or implied.”

On page 2 it reads:

![Page 2 of EAC Certification for Dominion 4.14-E](certmap6.png)

Note the second to last bullet point in “Significant of EAC Certification”:
“An EAC certification is **not**: A determination that the system is ready for use in an election.”

Then what might these certifications be for?

Are they meant to give the public a false sense of security?

Finally, compare the full [14-page EAC certification](https://www.dropbox.com/s/b0efp9zqshzj1cm/EAC%20Report_DVS4.14E_FinalCert_FINAL_7.2.15.pdf?dl=0) to the State of Minnesota Secretary of State Certification of Dominion Democracy Suite Version 4.14-E Voting System reproduced below:

![Page 1 of the State of Minnesota Secretary of State Certification of Dominion Democracy Suite Version 4.14-E Voting System](certmap7.png)

And page 2 of the same:

![Page 2 of the State of Minnesota Secretary of State Certification of Dominion Democracy Suite Version 4.14-E Voting System](certmap8.png)

What did you notice?

It reads very similarly, sometimes verbatim, to the EAC’s certifications, which the EAC admits do not indicate a voting machine is ready for use in an election.

###Digging Deeper (into Known Vulnerabilities)

Should the public have questions when 81 out of 87 counties in Minnesota DO NOT have certified election equipment according to the Election Assistance Commission, which under [Minnesota Statute 206.57 Subd.6](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/206.57) those election machines should have prior to use?

Are there consequences to certifications (the EAC certifications) which have disclaimers putting the value of the certification itself into question?

What *should* these certifications imply in a more common-sense world?

In the [3/15/2022 Nye County, Nevada County Commissioner’s meeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=234&v=GBKz1o_VqAE&feature=youtu.be) cyber security consultant Mark Cook [described his experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKz1o_VqAE&t=234s) with computers pre-internet in the CompuServe and Prodigy days, then as a consultant to protect companies from threats and seal off vulnerability, and finally with election systems.

Today, Dominion is a popular voting system which uses Microsoft SQL database, one which Mark was and is very familiar with as he used SQL databases from day 1. In the same meeting, he discussed how within the first minute of getting his hands on a Dominion system, he was able to access the backend and change votes without leaving a trace.

As has now been shown, certifications (and the lack of certifications) have not protected the right of men and women to vote freely and fairly in this country. For just one example, the [Mesa County Colorado Voting Systems Report #3: Election Database and Data Process Analysis](https://magaraccoon.com/docs/MesaCountyReport3.pdf) proves database manipulation happened inside the Colorado Dominion Voting Systems (DVS) Election Management System (EMS). Not once, but twice, in both the 2020 General Election and the 2021 Grand Junction Municipal Election.

Fortunately, there are signs around the country that people are becoming aware of the fundamental issue (that these machines are designed to allow manipulation) and using their voice to affect change how their county conducts elections. Yesterday, April 19, 2022, men and women spoke in Crow Wing, Dakota, and Sherburne counties ([video from Sherburne](https://erikvanmechelen.substack.com/p/open-forum-speakers-address-removing)). Recently, two counties in Nevada, Nye and Esmeralda have already decided not to use electronic voting equipment in upcoming elections. Which county commissioners will be the first in Minnesota to do the same and restore the voice that is constitutionally inherent in the right to vote to their constituents?

##Summary

The certifications are less than meaningless.

The machines are insecure and have been from the beginning.

It may not surprise you that Sequoia, which was integral to the country pivoting to electronic voting equipment through creating the hanging chad debacle, is still involved in the elections business. Sequoia was sold to Smartmatic and their current parent company is Dominion Voting Systems.

Why do our county commissioners and election officials continue to feel confident in these systems? Why are more and more people showing up to county commissioner meetings to share what they've learned? Is it possible to return to hand tallying paper ballots?

Next, let's begin a step by step journey following a vote through our entire election system. How a vote travels will illuminate the many flaws in our complex system.

Minnesota No. 1 in Voter ~~Turnout~~ Fraud

EDIT: remove sensationalism and sentimentality

I should have taken the September 2020 Project Veritas video about the Ilhan Omar-connected ballot harvesting scheme in Minneapolis as a sign to pay closer attention to the upcoming election. Fortunately mistakes can be learned from and put in a context which produces awareness for proper future action. Even to the point that minor mistakes are welcomed as a reality test and recalibration. But even though I went to bed early on 3 November, around 9:30 p.m., having read that the absentee ballots by the books would not need to be fully counted in battleground states on election night, when I awoke on 4 November I was nevertheless unsettled by what I came to understand happened in the early morning hours. But I didn’t have much time to dig in as we were paying a visit to my wife’s childhood friend’s family in State College, Pennsylvania the next day.

There, we were treated by our hosts to hours of uninterrupted and uncensored CNN coverage (as in 1984 the TV loomed ever-present in the background) detailing for instance Biden’s remarkable comeback turning a midnight Pennsylvania deficit of 555,189 votes into a tighter race. Attention everyone, let’s keep counting absentee ballots as long as it takes! On Saturday 7 November at 11:25 a.m. the Associated Press called the state for Biden—what gives any media outlet the authority to ‘call’ a race?—holding a 34,243 vote lead (by 15 December that was extended to a 81,660 vote margin). We were driving to the trailhead of the Thousand Steps on Jacks Mountain when my wife’s friend saw this notification and excitedly shared the news, which enlivened the mood for others in the car. I hiked peacefully enough as it really was a beautiful and sunny autumn day, however even a dip in a cold lake that afternoon could not lower my temperature enough to prevent my pent up anger spilling out that evening in an argument about whether skin color mattered relative to so many other dimensions of a human. I did not back down from but nor did I love my enemy that night. It made for an awkward breakfast the next morning where it was suggested that I might have done better to model my approach to conversation after the people of Japan, who my host had concluded on his trip there prioritize respect and politeness. The substance of the argument we had, though, has yet to be taken up. Moms and dads across the country have since made it clear in school board meetings that they understand critical race theory itself to be racist and therefore an inappropriate ideology to be peddled in publicly funded schools. At this point in my anecdote, however, I bet you haven’t failed to notice what else wasn’t said. By me.

For some reason I wasn’t ready to speak up about the election.

Meanwhile, the mainstream media was not giving up on the coverup.

Trump's lawsuits. No standing. The President of the United States had no standing. Therefore evidence wasn't shown because the vast majority of these cases didn't reach the evidentiary stage.

Early on, the media seemed to ignore election fraud news, but in February The Times went a different route. An article on the shadow campaign that saved the election included this already infamous sentence: “That’s why the participants want the secret history of the 2020 election told, even though it sounds like a paranoid fever dream—a well-funded cabal of powerful people, ranging across industries and ideologies, working together behind the scenes to influence perceptions, change rules and laws, steer media coverage and control the flow of information. They were not rigging the election; they were fortifying it.”

The fact that this article was written and published is one of many bizarre events I've noted in recent months. What these sentences describe is quite close to what happened.

Because to some extent the well funded cabal has succeeded in controlling the flow of information, the truth—including significant election-changing evidence—has taken time and effort to emerge.






Why did it take me so long to arrive in a place where I had developed the internal constitution to honestly investigate issues for myself? Why only then was I determined to think as clearly as possible while also tuning into my intuition on vital issues?

Even in May 2022, a good number of Minnesotans understand elections are rigged but don't understand that they can be rigged to the extent that Trump won Minnesota in 2020, probably comfortably.

In early 2021 A friend of mine said I should watch a video interivew between Robert David Steele and Martin Geddes. This introduced me to the Q posts and got me onto Telegram.

By summer, although still working on client books, I was getting restless. A number of influencers on Telegram had said things would be cleaned up soon and Trump would be reinserted. As dates came and went, I decided I had to do something.

First I tried to go to work for Project Veritas. When that didn't work out, I found an online group on Telegram whose stated mission was to produce audits in Minnesota.

Early on, I volunteered to help moderate the chat room. Soon after, I was asked to be the lead for communications. There was also a lead for freedom of information act (FOIA) requests, documents, and research. At first there was one admin, who oversaw everything and was the liason to the national leaders. Later, she was removed and two admins were put in place. I didn't speak with any of the national leaders until a few days before I decided to leave this group about 45 days after I joined it.

Several of the relationships formed in this mostly anonymous group were maintained and became valuable.

One person, Molly mentions Rick and Midwest Swamp Watch.

Still, though, I didn't go to a presentation until October 2021. (Brought camera... )

Writing in Markdown is easy! You can learn most of what you need to know with just a few examples.

To make *italic text* you surround it with single asterisks. To make **bold text** you surround it with double asterisks.

## Section One

You can start new sections by starting a line with two # signs and a space, and then typing your section title.

### Sub-Section One

You can start new sub-sections by starting a line with three # signs and a space, and then typing your sub-section title.

## Including a Chapter in the Sample Book

At the top of this file, you will also see a line at the top that says `{sample: true}`, immediately above the # Chapter Two title. This means that when you generate a preview of your book, or publish a new version of your book, this chapter will be included in a separate sample book that will be created. When you publish your book, this will give potential readers a sample book to read, when they are deciding whether they want to buy your book.

## Links

You can add web links easily. Here is a link to the [Leanpub homepage](https://leanpub.com).

When you are creating a web link, the part between the square brackets [ ] contains the words that people will see in your book, and the part in the round brackets ( ) is the web address you are linking to.

## Images

You can add an image to your book in a similar way.

First, add the image to the "resources" folder for your book. You will find the "resources" folder in your book's "manuscript" folder, which is at the top level of your book's folder in GitHub or Bitbucket.

If you look in your book's "resources" folder right now, you will see that there is an example image there with the file name "palm-trees.jpg". Here's how you can add this image to your book:

![Palm Trees](palm-trees.jpg)

As this example image shows, **on a line by itself** you type an exclamation point !, followed by the image caption between square brackets and the filename between round brackets.

To learn more about adding images, see [this link](https://leanpub.com/markua/read#images).

## Lists

### Numbered Lists

You make a numbered list like this:

1. kale
2. carrot
3. ginger

### Bulleted Lists

You make a bulleted list like this:

* kale
* carrot
* ginger

## Code Samples

You can add code samples really easily. Code can be in separate files (a "local" resource) or in the manuscript itself (an "inline" resource).

### Local Code Samples

Here's a local code resource:

{format: ruby}
![Hello World in Ruby](hello.rb)

### Inline Code Samples

Inline code samples can either be spans or figures.

A span looks like `puts "hello world"` this.

A figure looks like this:

```ruby
puts "hello"
```

You can also add a caption:

{caption: "Hello World in Ruby"}
```ruby
puts "hello"
```

To learn more about adding code samples, see [this link](https://leanpub.com/markua/read#code).

## Tables

You can insert tables easily inline, using the GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) table syntax:

| Header 1  | Header 2 |
| --- | --- |
| Content 1 | Content 2 |
| Content 3 | Content 4 Can be Different Length |

To learn more about adding tables, see [this link](https://leanpub.com/markua/read#tables).

## Math

You can easily insert math equations inline using either spans or figures.

Here's one of the kinematic equations `d = v_i t + \frac{1}{2} a t^2`$ inserted as a span inside a sentence.

Here's some math inserted as a figure.

{caption: "Something Involving Sums"}
```latexmath
\left|\sum_{i=1}^n a_ib_i\right|
\le
\left(\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2\right)^{1/2}
\left(\sum_{i=1}^n b_i^2\right)^{1/2}
```

To learn more about adding math, see [this link](https://leanpub.com/markua/read#math).

## How Book.txt Works

If you look in your book's "manuscript" folder, you will see there is a file called "Book.txt".

The "Book.txt" file is what our book generators use to decide what other files to include in your book. It is a list of the files in your "manuscript" folder that you decide you want to include in your book.

You can have multiple chapters in one file, but we recommend one chapter per file. This way, it's easier to navigate.

If you open the "Book.txt" file now, you will see the following list:

chapter1.txt
chapter2.txt
chapter3.docx
chapter4.docx

If you want to write in plain text, you should delete the following lines in the "Book.txt" file, and save the change:

chapter3.docx
chapter4.docx

(Those files are for people who want to write in Word, not in plain text.)

Now, the only two lines listed in the "Book.txt" file will be:

chapter1.txt
chapter2.txt

The next time you create generate a preview of your book, our book generators will only use the "chapter1.txt" and the "chapter2.txt" files, because they are the only files listed in the "Book.txt" file. Our book generators will ignore any files in your "manuscript" folder that are not listed in the "Book.txt" file, even if those other files are still in the "manuscript" folder.

## Creating a Preview of Your Book

You can generate a new version of your book any time by going to the "Preview" page for your book on Leanpub.

To go to the Preview page for your book, click on the Versions tab on Leanpub when you are working on your book. By default you will be taken to the "Preview New Version" page, which is where you'll be able to preview your book.

## Getting Help

Finally, to get help, go to the Help tab for your book in Leanpub and then either...

1. See our Getting Started page to learn how to get started.
2. See our Getting Help page to learn how to get help.
3. Clicking the link to the [Markua manual](https://leanpub.com/markua/read) on the Getting Help page. The Markua manual contains everything you need to know about writing in Markdown on Leanpub. (Our dialect of Markdown is called Markua.)

By the way, that was how you make a numbered list in Markdown.

You can also make a bulleted list like this:

* item one
* the second item
* another item

We hope that you find writing in Markdown on Leanpub to be simple and enjoyable!
