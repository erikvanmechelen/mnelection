It's time to bring transparency and ownership to our elections again.

Hand counting is a great way to increase transparency in the tabulation component of our election ecosystem. Do you want to be a part of not only learning and developing the latest and greatest hand tally approaches, but also to teach what you discover to others? 

Rick Weible, Director of the U.S. Council for Accurate and Secure Elections (USCASE) has already conducted 3 hand count studies in South Dakota and Minnesota, with more to come. With your financial support, for just one example, thousands of Minnesotans from all 87 counties (and all 4,110 precincts) will learn to tally votes manually, preparing them to be educated advocates. But this doesn't have to be limited to South Dakota or Minnesota. This is all about every county owning its elections once again. 

Speaking of taking ownership... A family from a county that was successfully able to do a hand count in the 2022 election stepped up financially to help get the rest of the country setup for hand counts because they want the rest of the country to feel connected to the election like they do now. Upfront costs were covered for 10,000 ballots purchased from ES&S and 3,000 are already printed using ballot images from Dodge County, Wisconsin.

Now, it only costs about $200 to cover costs for a single hand count study event in your area! This includes samples of error ballots and other machine-related tallying issues that demonstrate the value of ballot images and cast vote records.

Here's some feedback from a participant in the recent Minnesota study: 
- Surprised and impressed by how simple and accurate hand counting is.
- Mock run was very transparent; we could literally see who was winning.
- We had 50 people for this mock election; we can get plenty of volunteers
for a real one.
- The biggest takeaway was it made us feel like…the people own our
elections again.

Together we can make American elections home-grown, trustworthy, and beyond reproach.

Project Minnesota is a place for Minnesotans from all 87 counties to share updates and relevant information related to improving and reforming elections so that they can be trustworthy and transparent. 

Project Minnesota grew out of Midwest Seeds, a Substack newsletter with over 1,000 readers per post—with over 100 updates written in the last calendar year—when it became apparent that there was very little news coverage for critical election data and stories. However, one writer is not enough.

And if news agencies cannot produce reliable updates, then why wouldn't the citizens band together to do so themselves? As a proof of concept, Anoka County has already uploaded the videos from 60 speeches (and corresponding memos) given during county commissioner meetings throughout 2023 focused on reforming the county's elections.

Donations from a select group will serve to cover costs of ghost.io, a service where ProjectMinnesota.com lives. Free and paid subscribers to Project Minnesota receive the latest posts from their local area in Minnesota where work is being done to decentralize elections. 

In order to support what ghost.io refers to as a staff member, we are seeking a $50 donation from 60 Minnesota patriots who want to reclaim Minnesota's elections for We the People. This $3,000 will cover the first year's expenses and allow citizen journalists, reporters, and writers from across Minnesota to help their neighbors become instantly aware of the latest findings. By being informed about local happenings, citizens will then be able to make informed decisions and take effective actions in realizing lasting election reforms.
