# Chapter Two

Why did it take me so long to meet Rick and Susan?

Let me start by backtracking in time slightly.

On the third day of the Cyber Symposium, someone had asked what I was going to do next, and I said, We are going to audit the election in Minnesota. And then it was asked, How?, to which I couldn't properly respond. I simply hadn't done the background study to see the work of people like Rick and Susan, the latter who had drafted and submitted congressional and senate election contests as well as a petition to stop the certification of the 2020 election in Minnesota (and had come under pressure for doing so, given it appeared she was the only lawyer in Minnesota with the savvy and integrity and courage to do all of this). Susan also wrote the judicial complaint against Judge Sarah Grewing for not recusing herself from key election cases in May 2020 which essentially allowed the executive branch to circumvent the legislature to change election processes for 2020, in particular with regard to absentee and mail-in ballots. (Judge Sarah Grewing received 180 complaints out of the total 700 submitted in 2022.)

Now, I had heard about Rick before but it took some time to finally review his website, Midwest Swamp Watch, much less attend one of his events. In fact it took priming from Molly, who did a review of one of Rick's events earlier in the summer, and my dissatisfaction with the Telegram groups to get me off my butt and out from behind the computer screen to meet people and properly learn.

It's not that the Telegram groups weren't useful at all. There I met people like Nathan and Jeremy and Molly and many others. It's just that mostly anonymous online groups are much different from in-person groups supplemented by online communication. 

When I left the first Telegram group to join the second, I was quickly in a meeting where Jeff and Dan shared findings from the Mesa image, findings which were later reported by Jeff and Walter in the Mesa Report #3 and referenced in Jeff's nationwide cast vote record study. Also in group two was made a connection to David and Erin of New Mexico which later helped to facilitate event planning. 

Then I learned that people in Crow Wing County had invited Seth for an event with Rick and Susan at the Brainerd Exchange in December 2021. I arrived early, rare for me, and got to speak with Rick for a few minutes before, with encouragement from Teri, getting a photo with Seth. Teri and AJ invited me to sit with them. It was a good event and I remember starting to slowly appreciate more of the important election statutes and the work that had come before. 

Days later, the people attending county commissioner meetings in Crow Wing got a breakthrough. Although the county attorney recommended to the commissioners that they could not unseal their ballots, it was nevertheless voted 4-1 that the county would ask the Office of the Secretary of State to conduct a forensic audit of their county's 2020 election. This was the first request of its kind from a Minnesota commissioner group, and only, to date, which was significant for several reasons. 

First, it showed that people showing up to commissioner meetings, presenting information, proclaiming truth, and demanding their representatives take action, could actually achieve something. (Many if not all of these commissioner meetings are archived online-short of that the meeting minutes are public.) While many disagreed with the county attorney's recommendation regarding unsealing ballots (if a county can't unseal its own ballots, who has the authority?), putting the question to Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon allowed him in his role as the chief election officer of the state to weigh in. 

Now, Secretary Simon had previously been center stage in the circumvention of the Minnesota Legislature to change election laws in 2020, by strategically becoming the defendent in two lawsuits, which then allowed the changes to be so ordered which opened the floodgates to absentee mail-in ballots with a waived witness signature requirement. Given this background, Secretary Simon's response might have been predicted...

It is absurd that in his role as the Minnesota Secretary of State, that Steve Simon would reference those people who were asking the county to prove all the laws had been followed (by conducting the audit) as spreaders of disinformation or as having political or financial motive to corrode confidence in elections. In the case of elections which are run by a county, it is the county which needs to prove the laws and processes were followed-that only legal ballots from legal voters were counted accurately-because the people to date have not been given access (sometimes that access has been illegally and unlawfully withheld) to all the data required to make a definitive assessment. (Although, for many, the withholding of data is more than enough to arouse serious suspicion about the verifiability of 'official' results.)

Then, notably, and seemingly off topic, Secretary Simon shares his concern about foreign adversaries cheering our disunity, when it was apparently well understood by Donald John Trump when he signed Executive Order 13848 that it was not foreign interference, but rather *domestic* election interference (highlighted in Trump's only tweet in 2023 to date) that had usurped the will of the people time and again, but which in his November 15, 2022 speech emphasized this had become a personal problem for him to put an end to.
