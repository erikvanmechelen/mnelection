# Chapter 1 - Rick Weible

Rosemount City Hall, afternoon - check video…

Video camera hanging around my neck, I entered the … city hall? (Location?)



Emerging from Telegram into reality… 

october 13, about 2 month after the cyber symposium

a couple weeks prior, i’d been on a call w/ dan sundin and jeff o’donnell, not realizing the powerhouses they were 

There I soon met Teri, who was organizing this ‘I thought I voted’ event, where Rick Weible would soon present. The videographer was missing, so I offered to take his place. I was new to this, though. The camera sat in my lap as Rick began. And this was how I came to be introduced to someone from whom I’ve since learned a great deal. 

At that point, Rick was a tax refugee in South Dakota. In the aughts and teens, he had been mayor of a small town, St. Bonifacius, on the edge Hennepin County, where he’d in 2016 hacked into the KnowInk ePollbooks during the pitch and declined the contract (the only municipality in the county to do so). He’d had involvement in the Minnesota Republican Party. He knew about computers and election process. He was humble, kind, competent, and stood in a Biblical foundation. 

That evening he spoke first about expectations that the public has, or should have, from local government. While expectations were currently low, they should be high. Critically, how the government runs elections is an indicator of how well everything else is, or isn’t, done.
Since that night, Rick and I have spoken often and even worked together on a few things. Mostly, I have reported on the work he has done and the work he has inspired others to do. 

It was 
interestingly, Tom Hunt was there… later became elections manager in Anoka, where I’ve spent a bit of time.
