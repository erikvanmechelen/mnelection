# Preface - It's Time

Enough is enough. 

It's been about half a year since May 2022 when I began the first draft of *[S]elections in Minnesota: How Machines Controlled 2020 and Why We Must Return to Hand Counting Paper Ballots*. The book was published digitally a few weeks later in June, 2022, with the paperback version debuting on June 26, 2022.

Minnesotans in growing numbers are learning the truth about the charade that are our so-called elections and how few currently elected representatives seem to be on the side of the people. 

Desire for change was already clear in August. My Minnesota Secretary of State campaign garnered 36.9% of the vote (111,000 votes) running as a republican alternative to the MNGOP-endorsed candidate on Aug 9, 2022. I ran on a single issue: repairing elections with particular focus on the spider web of our electronic voting system.

In a massive show of transparency, none of the 87 Minnesota counties even released the cast vote record (CVR) reports from that primary election. Like any election, without a full forensic audit of ballots, ballot envelopes,election equipment, and registration systems, the results can never be confirmed by the voters. But the election fraud deniers, the mainstream media most of all, will gaslight all day and all night, 24/7. So effective is the repetition that some come to believe their lies and repeat them like Mr. Smith taking over a civilian's body in The Matrix. Election clerks and auditors robotically claim they are following the law. Still others who tell me they are on my side and your side ask, Where's the proof? 

But it's time to flip the table. 

Was the purpose of more tech really to make our elections *less* transparent? Less comprehensible? With data increasingly centralized in the hands of Secretaries of State?

Or could the apparent power grab by companies like Runbeck, Dominion, ES&S, ERIC, and Konnech be exactly what it looks like? An attempt to completely subvert elections making [Bev Harris and Bennie Smith's Fraction Magic](https://t.me/erikmn/2206) look like child's play? 

At day's end the illusion of a functioning election process is just one of many programs to uninstall from society, alongside global financial controls like the Fed and central banks, medical tyranny orchestrated by the WHO, and the captivity of your USA Inc. birth certificate and social security number. 

This deprogramming and deconditioning is necessary and it is remarkable that together We the People with guidance from God Almighty through Jesus's example and frequency have gotten this far without civilizational collapse. With active thermonuclear weapons for some decades, the war games have been touch and go a while now. Bio and information threats further complicate matters. 

No one said it would be easy to advance. But with the tools we have at our disposal, we can and we will.

The first edition of this book was written quickly and contained many mistakes. Thankfully readers were forgiving and even shared it with their county commissioners, making it an uncensorable resource for truth.

In this edition, corrections have been made and updates are given in the following areas: 

- key data points from late June through November 2022
- anecdotes from meetings and conversations with grassroots leaders country-wide
- county-level highlights, notes, and suggestions from a dozen Minnesota counties

God bless you,
