# The Role of the Office of the Secretary of State

Currently the elected Minnesota secretary of state gets to appoint several leadership positions, such as elections director, head of voter outreach, legislative liasion, and severl deputy secretary of state roles.

The Minnesota secretary of state himself/herself, is also the head elections official, and counted on for partnerships with counties, municipalities, and school districts for election education and administration. 

The Office is currently scored, according to the governor's annual report, on items like voter turnout and proportion of absentee ballots.

I think the Office should have an entirely different focus. And that is on auditing. 

Yes, there is already a state auditor, also elected every four years. 

But besides the county auditors and city clerks, whose ability to audit their own elections is currently limited by state statutes (the rules of the game), who within the governing body of Minnesota is responsible for carefully auditing the election results? 

What if the Office of the Secretary of State's main elections function was to provide resources, assistance, and creative help to counties, municipalities, and school districts to not only properly run their elections but also to thoroughly audit them? This change of course could possibly represent the greatest impact to overall confidence in the governance model used in Minnesota today by providing verification of the key election steps at the most local level. 

When town clerks, city election officials, and county election managers are working together to show the people, each and every election, that their process was not only within the rules but truly legitimate, then a foundation of a competent auditing skillset and mindset will be birthed, bottom up.
