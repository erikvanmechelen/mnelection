# Chapter One

Near the entrance I said hello to a man and he quickly asked whether I would like to wear a sticker. When I declined he said, "I understand not wanting to be a walking poster." Pulling back my jacket to reveal my t-shirt, I said, "But I already am."

The t-shirt read:

Minnesota No. 1 in Voter ~~Turnout~~ Fraud

This is an example of how to write a book chapter in plain text, formatted with Markdown formatting. This is a paragraph. You just write.

Blank lines separate paragraphs. This is the second paragraph.

This is the third paragraph. To make *italic text* you surround it with single asterisks. To make **bold text** you surround it with double asterisks.

You can start new chapters by starting a line with a # sign and a space, and then typing your chapter title.

"This is in quotes."

You make a thematic break with three asterisks, like this:

* * *

By the way, the above formatting is actually *all* you need to know to write a novel using Markdown formatting. To write a technical book, however, you'll need to know a bit more Markdown.

We have a handy manual at https://leanpub.com/markua/read and we have a Markdown quick-start guide in Chapter 2.

Or, if you're ready to start writing your book, simply select all the text in this file, delete it, and then start writing! (Start with # Your Chapter Name and then a blank line, and then write your first paragraph.)
