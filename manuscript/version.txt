# Previous Versions Notes

The Election System is a system with many features. Cheating, the definition of which differs from what is legal, can happen before and after the polls close. Absentee mail-in voting, in my opinion, is an avenue for cheating, even if the process is legal. There are many more areas open to cheating, as will be discussed at length. 

I've also participated in hand recounts, hand count demonstrations. 

The first edition in 2022 of this book was written quickly during the 2022 SOS campaign and contained many mistakes. (The second edition edited in even less time, 2024, with this quick update occuring on a single day, March 9, 2025.) Thankfully readers were forgiving and even shared it both with one another and with their county commissioners, making it an uncensorable resource for truth and an antidote to wilful ignorance and plausible deniability. Indeed, one of the commissioners shown this resource in 2022 in early 2025 voted against the purchase of new KNOWiNK electronic poll pads. Even though he was on the losing side of the vote, that commissioner showed he was listening and working to improve things from his position.
