# Chapter Three

9/11/2001 landed on my 14th birthday. Unlike many American kids, who were shown the images of the planes striking the towers over and over in school, for me, school was cancelled. Still, half a world away, in Jakarta, Indonesia, I watched. 

A few years later, still living in southeast Asia, when the United States military forces went to Iraq, my Pakistani and Indian classmates paused their debate over the Cricket World Cup to commentate on the real reasons the United States (rather, the Federal Corporation) was meddling, yet again, in foreign territory.

President Donald John Trump, brilliantly planted by the military was the first Commander in Chief, since John Fitzgerald Kennedy to attempt to disrupt the Washington regime and its worldwide banking and criminal syndicates which has for so long benefitted from endless foreign wars and as a result maintained their grip on power.

This regime is presently losing (has possibly already lost?) its stranglehold. In my case, it took a bit of reading to better comprehend the situation. And therefore *peace*, the kind of peace the 35th President of the United States spoke about on June 10, 1963, is not only possible in our lifetimes, but it can and will last for a long, long time, if we are ready to maintain it. Even as it seems a great reckoning is upon us, for me, peace is there waiting for us.

When I returned from high school graduation in Beijing to Minnesota in 2006 for college I did not know that I would live in this state for the next 17 years. Nor did I know I would live in three parts of Minneapolis, to be able to appreciate its complexity from at least these three angles, and decide to stay when I could easily have skipped town. Nor did I know that I would become so interested in restoring trustworthiness to elections as a starting point toward once again taking part in a path to peace here and for the entire planet, for men, women, and children everywhere. 

As a civilian, it has been tricky but not impossible to follow the plan which made Donald John Trump correctly and legally a wartime president with wartime powers. In part this is indicated in bipartisan legislation such as 50 USC 33 ยง1550, national emergencies packaged inside executive orders such as EO13818, and how by such executive orders like EO13912 and EO13919 which addressed the unaddressed (by Congress) national emergencies to federalize the National Guard and Reserves. (It is 50 USC 33 ยง1621 which allows the president to declare war through national emergencies.)

But well before I could begin to comprehend any of that in mid-to-late 2023, I found myself in early 2022 sitting in a county commissioner board room in Dakota County. Here, an altogether foreign language was being spoken. Consent agendas, motions, and a way of conducting meetings that was often incomprehensible to me, being naive as I was. On raised desks the county commissioners sat in an arc flanked by the county administrator and attorney. While these meetings are generally livestreamed and archived, sometimes on YouTube, being present in the room allows one to feel the energy, the emotions, the tension, and the slow progress being made. 

In Minnesota, these meetings usually include an open comment or public forum period, at either the opening or the closing, where people can sign in to give two- or three-minute speeches on any topic they wish. This space is made available because it isn't so easy or quick to get an agenda item where a proper discussion may be had, especially on topics such as election reform. As such, these open forum segments often have odd rules announced directly preceding them about how the county commissioners may ask questions but are not to have a discussion or make any decisions about the information being shared.

Since I sat in, participated, and spoke in a number of these forums, there is much to share, but for the moment it's important to recognize the following, which is in large part why I echoed the advice of people like David from New Mexico and continued to follow the lead of people like Rick who was showing us in Minnesota (and in South Dakota) one way to approach getting work done in these settings. The lesson is that county commissioner meetings, and so too city council meetings and township board meetings, allow for direct communication *on the public record* between people and their elected (and appointed) representatives. Even in a future world where by and large representatives will have to be responsive to the people (because we will once again have a functioning election system which can replace representatives), it will be necessary and healthy for not only the people to be well practiced in the language, definitions, and terminology of these meetings, but also for the representatives to be well practiced in not only hearing but also listening to and understanding concerns brought by the people.

That day in Dakota County, I listened to short speeches from people like Rick and Heidi. They informed the county of issues like the electronic security of their voting systems. Or the problem of dropboxes. Or the lack of party balance at the absentee ballot boards. (We will discuss at length, but Minnesota Statutes 203B.121 BALLOT BOARDS is a good place to start for current election law relating to receiving, accepting, rejecting, and processing absentee ballots.) In time the county board would move ever so slightly on dropboxes but small wins like these didn't seem to address the outright lack of transparency. 

I'm not certain of this but I believe part of the reason Dakota County was chosen as a place to advocate for election reform because of the shortcomings in the 2020 postelection review process. To review the statutes, start with 206.89 POSTELECTION REVIEW OF VOTING SYSTEMS. 

For one stark example, in the 2020 postelection review for precinct 4950, by my count 863 ballots were missing, or 65%. The acceptable difference by statute is only 0.5%, which means the total adjusted difference looks like it was 130(!) times the acceptable difference. By statute, this should have triggered additional audits, but it did not. Like the unusual disappearance of Building 7, hundreds of missing ballots from a single precinct did not make the news.

When things don't add up in the official review, and then the very statute which is written to protect voters is ignored, is it a surprise that people like Susan helped as she did to draft and submit both the congress and senate election contests as well as the petition to stop the certification of Minnesota's election?

(There are more details to the postelection review story but it is not my story to tell.)

After the first or second Dakota County commissioner meeting I attended, after the group of people who consistently came in support and who participated in the meetings had gone on with their day, Rick invited me to sit down, in the foyer of the Dakota County Government Center, to see a bit more about what he had discovered and was working on. Without my notes on hand I am going on memory. What stood out to me was a discussion about the databases and dashboards that the Office of the Secretary of State in Minnesota must have in order to keep track of things; that is, additional databases or dashboards above and beyond the Statewide Voter Registration System.

It must be said that at this point I was still trying to understand how it was that 734,000 absentee ballots were not connected with voters in the Statewide Voter Registration System on November 29, 2020, 25 days after the election and five days after the certification of the election by the Minnesota State Canvassing Board. (734,000 ballots works out to almost 39% of all absentee ballots accepted in the 2020 general election in Minnesota.) But data requests of the registrations and voter histories had been made, which are given to people who make the request, on the specific day they are requested (which is why the November 29 date is referenced, because the data sent by the Minnesota Office of the Secretary of State was for that date only - for instance it could have been updated the day before or the day after). 

At the time it wasn't required by law for the work on the absentee ballots to completed until about six weeks after election day, but the election manager in Dakota County shared that it only took the push of a button to complete that work. It became a bit of a mystery then why the button wasn't pushed in 2020 (in many counties) and why there were again significant delays in pushing the button after the 2022 midterms.

Now, if I could ask my classmates from India and Pakistan what they thought about this, I wonder what they would say? Even at 13 or 14 years of age, they were at minimum capable of questioning the official narrative. When I chatted with a friend in the Philippines a few months after November 3rd, he said we had better figure it out.

Of course, the truth about 9/11, about the twin towers' collapse, about Building 7, and so much else, wasn't deciphered in a day. And neither has it been revealed to the public in one fell swoop. (For the time being, a few thousand documents relating to 9/11 have been declassified.) And neither would the mystery of precinct 4950 be answered in a day, nor the apparent anxiety about pushing a button to transmit absentee data be understood immediately.
