*"The stories of these times will be told as all stories are told... around the campfire."*

When elections can be thoroughly audited, one part of our governance system increases in value: the elected roles. Audit well enough, correct mistakes quickly enough, and then all voters win. Even with increased confidence in that elected part of that entity referred to as 'government', there is still the remainder of it over which the citizen must be watchful. Today, in Minnesota, it is clear that various parts of the government have either failed to identify, or failed to remediate, or arguably even facilitated fraud of different sorts. Who knows what a thorough audit of all of Minnesota's government would find. 

Beginning with an auditable election system seems like an appropriate starting point. After all, an elected governor in Minnesota not only appoints about 20 commissioners to the major state departments but also appoints upwards of 500 government positions. The secretary of state appoints key roles like the director of elections and the liason to the legislature. Of course, the 67 senators and 134 representatives who (sometimes write and) vote on bills can in the case of election acts change the very rules of the election game. Because of their function to vote on rule changes to the process itself, there is an advantage in ensuring those candidates who actually won their elections take the seats. Right now, we live near the worst case scenario, which is, we cannot say for certain in many cases. This could quite simply be addressed with a heightened focus and rigor in auditing. 

Of course, elections in Minnesota have seemingly almost always (if not always) been hotly contested. Beginning with the very first gubernatorial election in October 1857, which, after claims of voter registration fraud and other issues, was only sorted out seven months later. The recent two or three decades have brought significant changes and some of these changes will be highlighted in the writing to come. But, for emphasis, this book is disinterested in the elected officers and their party affiliation; instead, this book aims to explore the ideas and implementation feasibility of improving election audits. One quite simple way to improve auditability is to simplify the overall process. We will have this discussion. Let's start with where we are now...

In Minnesota, there are serious issues with every step of the input/output system that will be referred to in this book as the election system. From registration to absentee ballots to counting to reporting to results, every step has been called into question. It is not too late to reverse course where certain ideas have led to a decrease in confidence in the overall government entity—first and foremost the major push for electronic machines and software which are difficult to audit or no-excuse absentee ballots. This book will go through each phase of an election: voter registration, absentee ballots, election day, election night, reporting, and audits. Within that framework, the rules of the game, the Minnesota election codes/laws, a 500-page PDF document comprising chapters 200-212 of the Minnesota Statutes, will be frequently referenced.

In Minnesota, we have paper ballots, yes, but instead of counting and tallying manually, we are compelled to use computers to do so. The computer first scans the ballot. Then it interprets the scan. This two-part process generates what's called a cast vote record, which has two components: 1) the ballot image, which is a computer image file created by the computer scan of the paper ballot, and 2) a record detailing which candidate received a vote for each election on the ballot. (In Minnesota, as of 2023, the ballot images portion has become hidden from the public through data classification; prior, they were never shown publically nor were they ever officially used in audits; their classification may have been prompted by the volume of requests to see the cast vote records.)

Complicating matters is the fact, shown during testing in Tarrant County, Texas, that the computers (at least the particular model of the Hart Intercivic tabulator being used there) can apparently alter the ballot images after scanning the ballot. This manipulation was obviously technically possible even before the direct evidence gathered and witnessed. It looks like this: 1) computer scans ballot, 2) computer runs a program to change the image, either altering the image directly or making a duplicate with a change and deleting the original. Even if this feature hasn't yet been demonstrated in Minnesota, what safeguards might be put in place to ensure it doesn't? Are any counties using Hart's tabulators looking into this? Are the other counties, which are using ES&S or Dominion tabulators, preparing to defend against this programmatic subversion?

Even though ballot images were standard since the electronic tabulators were distributed nationwide in the early 2000s, they have not yet—after more than 20 years—been included in a standard audit in Minnesota. These images are not required to even be reviewed by any election judge, city clerk, elections manager, or county auditor. During the 2021 and 2022 period, it became apparent that communications were occurring between county auditor offices and the Office of the Secretary of State about how to best respond to requests for the cast vote records. 

Insider Max Hailperin, in [this MinnPost article](https://www.minnpost.com/other-nonprofit-media/2022/09/election-activists-are-seeking-the-cast-vote-record-from-2020-heres-what-it-is-and-why-they-want-it/) regarding the cast vote records said, "The remarkable thing is that there’s really a lot less here than it might seem in both directions. It’s way less ominous than it could be, but it’s also way less useful." Hailperin is one of the interesting people ... involved in legislation? ...also appointed by governor to the 2013 Electronic Roster Task Force :) hmmm (identify these players!) 

?LOL not that useful... Any outside observer who follows that the computers themselves are looking at pictures they've taken of ballots to tally the vote selections can easily wonder why after two decades we are not even attempting to audit those pictures side by side with the paper ballots themselves.

(haven't even touched on the ems—reporting software, absentee process, etc. yet)

It may seem, based on reading the current 500-page document of election statutes, noticing the trend within the Minnesota Legislature, and listening to the claims of the Minnesota Secretary of State, that there's no clear path (anytime soon) to reviewing or auditing the digital records of our most recent elections. Therefore, with ballots and records likely not retained from previous elections, it's becoming difficult to even say, for sure, what happened, not only in a recent election but in ANY election occurring prior to 22 months ago (this is the federal preservation of records duration under 52 USC § 20701, with penalties outlined in § 20702). 

At present, in-person and absentee ballots are collected by separate methods. In-person votes are cast by voters at the precinct polling place on election day, while absentee ballots can be cast in person during the early voting period or mailed in to various locations—usually, these mail-in ballots get processed at the county level, bypassing any handling or oversight by municipalities (cities and townships). 

The basic sense that audits are not being done has decreased confidence and led increasing numbers wanting change. 

What change? To a process that everyone can both comprehend and verify for themselves. That would be [beautiful](https://projectminnesota.com/beautiful), wouldn't it?

Measureable desire for change was already clear on August 9, 2022. A scarcely 90-day campaign for Minnesota Secretary of State achieved about 36.8% of the vote (nearly 111,000 votes, if the reported numbers can be believed) running as a republican alternative to the MNGOP-endorsed candidate—after being effectively blocked from the endorsement process—but that was only part of the beginning of my education into the system of control that is our election system. It wasn't until later that I sat down to read the more than 500-page rule book known as the election statutes and combine that information with my experience speaking with advocates, county auditors, city clerks, county commissioners, and numerous non-government advocates for fair and auditable elections.

During the brief campaign, input from political consultants was not sought and no campaign donations were accepted. Instead of a traditional campaign, which allows money to be funneled around and messages to be diluted or tailored to the political machine's liking, the focus was on education and action. Instead of focusing on speaking events, county commissioner meetings (and city council meetings and town board meetings) were attended with the people, where we attempted to inform local decision makers of their options—at the time, in 2022, it was still up to the county and municipality whether they used electronic tabulators but that has since changed, removing their choice. 

When invited to speak, in one case by a non-party affiliated group, and another time by an MNGOP-endorsed Republican candidate, MNGOP operatives tried to influence the organizers into cancelling: they did not back down to the pressure.

Running on a single issue, to repair elections with a particular focus on the tangled yet sophisticated web of the electronic voting system, was surprisingly simple and welcome. A bulk of the campaign was spent trying to get counties to turn over their cast vote records and ballot images (which at the time were still unclassified, public records); only one Minnesota county did for 2020 (Fillmore), about a month after I was given the first cast vote record file to my knowledge ever shown to the public, from the Chisago County primary election of August 9, 2022. 

At the end of the previous year (2021), Crow Wing County commissioners with great encouragement from the people passed a resolution seeking to audit their county's 2020 election. Instead of doing the audit themselves, though, they sent a request for help from the Secretary of State, Steve Simon. He rather quickly denied this request in early January, 2022, keeping the inner workings of the system closed to public viewing.

But even with the above 'run for office', I was somewhat late to the thinking about the Election System. Maybe my early career work in IT for a Fortune 100 helped me learn just enough about computers to follow the basic plot. Or maybe it was my interest in the tabletop board game Diplomacy, apparently one of JFK's favorites, where there are no rules against nor to penalize cheating. 

My vantage point into the opaque election system had only begun months earlier in an inquisitive way, around summer of 2021, online, through a Telegram group seeking Minnesota's first true audit. Shortly after joining the online chat channel and volunteering to help out with communications, I was invited to a convention in South Dakota.

I would become one of perhaps only a few dozen people at each of the Cyber Symposium in Sioux Falls, South Dakota in August 2021, The Moment of Truth Summit in Springfield, Missouri, August 2022, and the Election Crime Bureau, Springfield, Missouri, in August 2023. From preparation for, participation in, and reflection on those multi-day events, I learned a great deal and realized how much more there was to learn. Those events were hosted by Mike Lindell, currently running for Governor of Minnesota in 2026. 

In 2022 I attended a number of county commissioner, city council, and township supervisor meetings in a number of Minnesota counties, such as Dakota, Sherburne, and Wright, as well as various meetings with election officials, county election managers, and clerks included in the normal flow of elections (public accuracy tests in Wright or a canvassing/certification meeting in Hennepin) and sometimes because something had gone wrong (e.g. Dakota's 2021 school board election).

In late 2022 and into 2023 my focus shifted to the budding group in Anoka County, which later decided to call themselves the Anoka County Election Integrity Team, or simply ACEIT, pronounced "Ace it". That team became a hub for advocates from a number of counties, including Ramsey, Washington, Hennepin, and between 5 and 7 counties were represented (at the citizen level) for the 2024 Anoka County Canvassing/Certification Board meeting, an example of ACEIT's impact. The group had educated its commissioners and supported a number of cities in not only asking to be including in the automatic hand count audits (called post-election reviews) but also in one case, the City of Oak Grove, of cancelling their KNOWiNK electronic poll pad leasing contract with Anoka County. ACEIT has done great work to help raise considerable awareness about the increasingly centralized system. Oak Grove's action led to a letter, ostensibly sent by Anoka Elections Manager Tom Hunt, with clear help from Anoka County Auditor Brad Johnson, which also quotes Steve Simon, the Minnesota Secretary of State, to the election judges throughout Anoka County just ahead of the 2024 general election warning them not to use paper poll books, or else face a felony charge. 

In 2024 my focus was on electronic poll books... (see Simon's Sensors)

In 2025, a significant contribution was on poll pads, speaking side by side with Isanti Auditor...

The Election System is a system with many features. Cheating, the definition of which differs from what is legal, can happen before and after the polls close. Absentee mail-in voting, in my opinion, is an avenue for cheating, even if the process is legal. There are many more areas open to cheating, as will be discussed at length. 

I've also participated in hand recounts, hand count demonstrations. 

The first edition in 2022 of this book was written quickly during the 2022 SOS campaign and contained many mistakes. (The second edition edited in even less time, 2024, with this quick update occuring on a single day, March 9, 2025.) Thankfully readers were forgiving and even shared it both with one another and with their county commissioners, making it an uncensorable resource for truth and an antidote to wilful ignorance and plausible deniability. Indeed, one of the commissioners shown this resource in 2022 in early 2025 voted against the purchase of new KNOWiNK electronic poll pads. Even though he was on the losing side of the vote, that commissioner showed he was listening and working to improve things from his position.

In this now fourth edition, corrections have been made and updates are offered in the following areas:
- The Rules of the Game
- Every Voter Wins
- An Input/Output System
- The 6 Phases: Voter Registration, Absentee Ballots, Election Day, Election Night, Reporting, Audits

(REMOVE THIS ONE?) 

As a mentor has said, the stories of these times will be told around the campfire, passed down from generation to generation. Please bear that in mind as what is shared in this book comes merely from my experience, a way to put my observations, recollections, and insights into readers' hands. 

It is intended to start a statewide conversation. 

Therefore, do not take anything here as authoritative but rather take the information on board to consider and to verify for oneself. It is sometimes hard but often refreshing to discover one has been quite wrong about something. If only to take responsibility for any harm done and to prepare to learn the next thing one is wrong about or about which he had barely even considered.

It's been quite the journey, hasn't it?

And there is much more to do.
