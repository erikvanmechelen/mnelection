*"The stories of these times will be told as all stories are told... around the campfire."*

When elections can be thoroughly audited, one part of our governance system increases in value: the elected roles. Audit well enough, correct mistakes quickly enough, and then all voters win. Even with increased confidence in that elected part of that entity referred to as 'government', there is still the remainder of it over which the citizen must be watchful. Today, in Minnesota, it is clear that various parts of the government have either failed to identify, or failed to remediate, or arguably even facilitated fraud of different sorts. Who knows what a thorough audit of all of Minnesota's government would find. 

Beginning with an auditable election system seems like an appropriate starting point. After all, an elected governor in Minnesota not only appoints about 20 commissioners to the major state departments but also appoints upwards of 500 government positions. The secretary of state appoints key roles like the director of elections and the liason to the legislature. Of course, the 67 senators and 134 representatives who (sometimes write and) vote on bills can in the case of election acts change the very rules of the election game. Because of their function to vote on rule changes to the process itself, there is an advantage in ensuring those candidates who actually won their elections take the seats. Right now, we live near the worst case scenario, which is, we cannot say for certain in many cases. This could quite simply be addressed with a heightened focus and rigor in auditing. 

Of course, elections in Minnesota have seemingly almost always (if not always) been hotly contested. Beginning with the very first gubernatorial election in October 1857, which, after claims of voter registration fraud and other issues, was only sorted out seven months later. The recent two or three decades have brought significant changes and some of these changes will be highlighted in the writing to come. But, for emphasis, this book is disinterested in the elected officers and their party affiliation; instead, this book aims to explore the ideas and implementation feasibility of improving election audits. One quite simple way to improve auditability is to simplify the overall process. We will have this discussion. Let's start with where we are now...

In Minnesota, there are serious issues with every step of the input/output system that will be referred to in this book as the election system. From registration to absentee ballots to counting to reporting to results, every step has been called into question. It is not too late to reverse course where certain ideas have led to a decrease in confidence in the overall government entity—first and foremost the major push for electronic machines and software which are difficult to audit or no-excuse absentee ballots. This book will go through each phase of an election: voter registration, absentee ballots, election day, election night, reporting, and audits. Within that framework, the rules of the game, the Minnesota election codes/laws, a 500-page PDF document comprising chapters 200-212 of the Minnesota Statutes (and others relevant to elections), will be frequently referenced. (In Minnesota, in addition to the statutes, the secretary of state may add rules: the 500-page PDF as of 2025 includes about 368 pages of statutes and an additional 132 pages of rules.)

In Minnesota, we have paper ballots, yes, but instead of counting and tallying manually, we are compelled to use computers to do so. The computer first scans the ballot. Then it interprets the scan. This two-part process generates what's called a cast vote record, which has two components: 1) the ballot image, which is a computer image file created by the computer scan of the paper ballot, and 2) a record detailing which candidate received a vote for each election on the ballot. (In Minnesota, as of 2023, the ballot images portion has become hidden from the public through data classification; prior, they were never shown publically nor were they ever officially used in audits; their classification may have been prompted by the volume of requests to see the cast vote records.)

Complicating matters is the fact, shown during testing in Tarrant County, Texas, that the computers (at least the particular model of the Hart Intercivic tabulator being used there) can apparently alter the ballot images after scanning the ballot. This manipulation was obviously technically possible even before the direct evidence gathered and witnessed. It looks like this: 1) computer scans ballot, 2) computer runs a program to change the image, either altering the image directly or making a duplicate with a change and deleting the original. Even if this feature hasn't yet been demonstrated in Minnesota, what safeguards might be put in place to ensure it doesn't? Are any counties using Hart's tabulators looking into this? Are the other counties, which are using ES&S or Dominion tabulators, preparing to defend against this programmatic subversion?

Even though ballot images were standard since the electronic tabulators were distributed nationwide in the early 2000s, they have not yet—after more than 20 years—been included in a standard audit in Minnesota. These images are not required to even be reviewed by any election judge, city clerk, elections manager, or county auditor. During the 2021 and 2022 period, it became apparent that communications were occurring between county auditor offices and the Office of the Secretary of State about how to best respond to requests for the cast vote records. 

It may seem, based on reading the current 500-page document of election statutes, noticing the trend within the Minnesota Legislature, and listening to the claims of the Minnesota Secretary of State, that there's no clear path (anytime soon) to reviewing or auditing the digital records of our most recent elections. Therefore, with ballots and records likely not retained from previous elections, it's becoming difficult to even say, for sure, what happened, not only in a recent election but in ANY election occurring prior to 22 months ago (this is the federal preservation of records duration under 52 USC § 20701, with penalties outlined in § 20702). 

At present, in-person and absentee ballots are collected by separate methods. In-person votes are cast by voters at the precinct polling place on election day, while absentee ballots can be cast in person during the early voting period or mailed in to various locations. Usually, these mail-in ballots get processed at the county level (this can be reversed, brought back to city-level processing, through a city council resolution). When the county processes these ballots, by definition any oversight the municipalities (cities and townships) have is bypassed and it means that the results at the precinct level (also by definition) do not initially include the absentee numbers. (Once everything is aggregated in the election management software and shared with the secretary of state's office, that office reports unofficial holistic precinct numbers on election night.)

Then we get to audits. The basic sense that audits are not being done has decreased confidence and led increasing numbers wanting change. What change? To a process that everyone can both comprehend and verify for themselves. That would be [beautiful](https://projectminnesota.com/beautiful), wouldn't it?

In 2024 my focus was on electronic poll books... (see Simon's Sensors)

In 2025, a significant contribution was on poll pads, speaking side by side with Isanti Auditor...

The Election System is a system with many features. Cheating, the definition of which differs from what is legal, can happen before and after the polls close. Absentee mail-in voting, in my opinion, is an avenue for cheating, even if the process is legal. There are many more areas open to cheating, as will be discussed at length. 

I've also participated in hand recounts, hand count demonstrations. 

The first edition in 2022 of this book was written quickly during the 2022 SOS campaign and contained many mistakes. (The second edition edited in even less time, 2024, with this quick update occuring on a single day, March 9, 2025.) Thankfully readers were forgiving and even shared it both with one another and with their county commissioners, making it an uncensorable resource for truth and an antidote to wilful ignorance and plausible deniability. Indeed, one of the commissioners shown this resource in 2022 in early 2025 voted against the purchase of new KNOWiNK electronic poll pads. Even though he was on the losing side of the vote, that commissioner showed he was listening and working to improve things from his position.

In this now fourth edition, corrections have been made and updates are offered in the following areas:
- The Rules of the Game
- Every Voter Wins
- An Input/Output System
- The 6 Phases: Voter Registration, Absentee Ballots, Election Day, Election Night, Reporting, Audits

(REMOVE THIS ONE?) 

As a mentor has said, the stories of these times will be told around the campfire, passed down from generation to generation. Please bear that in mind as what is shared in this book comes merely from my experience, a way to put my observations, recollections, and insights into readers' hands. 

It is intended to start a statewide conversation. 

Therefore, do not take anything here as authoritative but rather take the information on board to consider and to verify for oneself. It is sometimes hard but often refreshing to discover one has been quite wrong about something. If only to take responsibility for any harm done and to prepare to learn the next thing one is wrong about or about which he had barely even considered.

It's been quite the journey, hasn't it?

And there is much more to do.
