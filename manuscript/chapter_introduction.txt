How much should verification, transparency, and accuracy be valued in elections? What about security? And timeliness of results? Or the capability to remedy mistakes? To what extent should the rules be flexible, including the statutes as well as the administrative rules which the Minnesota secretary of state may add on? 

Is it possible to design an election system where every voter wins? 

When each step of an election can be checked, or even audited (possibly in real time), then one part of our governance system increases in value: the elected roles. Audit well enough, correct mistakes quickly enough, and then every voter wins. (The quickest way to enable more complete audits is to simplify the overall process - at minimum this removes workload from administrators post election receiving data requests from citizen auditors.) Then, even with increased confidence in that elected part of that entity referred to as 'government', there is still the remainder of it over which the citizen must be watchful. Today, in Minnesota, it is clear that various parts of the government have either failed to identify, or failed to remediate, or arguably even facilitated fraud of different sorts. At the most lenient, there was too much load on the system and (so far) $9 billion has been wasted by the government itself. Who knows what a thorough audit of all of Minnesota's government will find. 

This book is not going to engage directly with those areas. But it is reasonable to ask, What can we do in the face of the duration and scale of the present abuses of government programs? Beginning with an auditable election system is one starting point. 

Consider the impact of elections... Executive branch roles like an elected governor in Minnesota not only appoints about 20 commissioners to the major state departments but also appoints upwards of 500 government positions. The secretary of state appoints key roles like the director of elections and the liaison to the legislature. Elected roles in the judicial branch are not always heavily contested but that could change. And of course, the 67 senators and 134 representatives comprising the Minnesota Legislature who (sometimes write and) vote on bills can in the case of election acts change the very rules of the election game. Because of their function to vote on rule changes to the process itself, there is an advantage in ensuring those candidates who actually won their elections take the seats. Right now, we live near the worst case scenario, which is, we cannot say for certain in many cases, especially in lower-turnout local elections, such as for city council or town board. This could quite simply be addressed with a heightened focus and rigor in auditing. 

Of course, elections in Minnesota have seemingly almost always (if not always) been hotly contested and also evolving as a system. Beginning with the very first gubernatorial election in October 1857, which, after claims of voter registration fraud and other issues, was only sorted out seven months later. The recent two or three decades have brought significant changes and some of these changes will be highlighted in the writing to come. But, for emphasis, this book is disinterested in the particulars of unique elected officers and their party affiliation; instead, this book aims to explore the ideas, feasibility, and actual implementation surrounding the overall election system and, in particular, election audits. One quite simple way to improve auditability is to simplify the overall process. We will have this discussion. Let's start with where we are now...

In Minnesota, this writer, a five-year citizen auditor, sees serious issues with every step of the input/output system that will be referred to in this book as the election system; maybe this conclusion will also be the reader's conclusion, or perhaps not. From registration to absentee ballots to electronic tabulation to reporting and audits, every step has been called into question. It is not too late to reverse course where certain ideas have led to a decrease in confidence in the overall government entity, ideas such as the major push for electronic machines and software which are difficult to audit or no-excuse absentee ballots that go through the mail. 

This book will go through each phase of an election: voter registration, absentee ballots, election day, election night, reporting, and audits. Within that framework, the rules of the game, the Minnesota election laws/rules, a 500-page PDF document comprising chapters 200-212 of the Minnesota Statutes (and others relevant to elections), will be frequently referenced. (In Minnesota, in addition to the statutes, the secretary of state may add rules: the 500-page PDF as of 2025 includes about 368 pages of statutes and an additional 132 pages of rules.)

It may seem, based on reading the current 500-page document of election statutes, noticing the trend within the Minnesota Legislature, and listening to the claims of the Minnesota Secretary of State, that there's no clear path (anytime soon) to reviewing or auditing the digital records of our most recent elections. Therefore, with ballots and records likely not retained from previous elections, it's becoming difficult to even say, for sure, what happened, not only in a recent election but in ANY election occurring prior to 22 months ago (this is the federal preservation of records duration under 52 USC § 20701, with penalties outlined in § 20702). 

Meanwhile, the workload for election administrators is probably at an all-time high: even with iPads that check voters in; even with the electronic tabulators to count/tally votes and the modems which transmit results embedded in those tabulators; even with software which aggregates reporting. There is still so much work to do prior to the 46 days of absentee voting, and during those 46 days, and then election day, election night, and post election. Electronics were sold with the promise of efficiency and efficacy but they haven't delivered. Maybe the way Taiwan does elections, tech-free, on a single day, could give Americans, and Minnesotans, a model to borrow from. 

My focus as a citizen auditor has shifted slightly from making a catalog of violations to pointing out obvious areas for improvement that are also sustainable. Some of these will be sprinkled throughout the book but it is probably better if the reader thinks independently to develop an informed opinion. 

Now in its 4th edition, [S]elections in Minnesota has undergone a complete rewrite. (See what has changed in the Appendices.)

As a mentor has said, the stories of these times will be told around the campfire, passed down from generation to generation. Please bear that in mind as what is shared in this book comes merely from my experience, a way to put my observations, recollections, and insights into readers' hands. 

It is intended to start a statewide conversation. 

Therefore, do not take anything here as authoritative but rather take the information on board to consider and to verify for oneself. It is sometimes hard but often refreshing to discover one has been quite wrong about something. If only to take responsibility for any harm done and to prepare to learn the next thing one is wrong about or about which he had barely even considered.

It's been quite the journey, hasn't it?

And there is much more to do.
