Minnesotans in growing numbers are learning the truth about the charade that are our so-called elections and how few currently elected representatives seem to be on the side of the people as evidenced by their email, phone, and in-person interactions, let alone any tangible efforts. 

The lack of courage is unsurprising once a light is shone on how easy it is to undermine the people's hoped-for outcomes to select a kind of person unwilling to fight from within the system that chose them, whether or not that individual realizes they were selected, not elected. 

Measureable desire for change was already clear on August 9, 2022. My 117-day Minnesota Secretary of State campaign garnered 36.9% of the vote (nearly 111,000 votes) running as a republican alternative to the MNGOP-endorsed candidate. 

Input from political consultants was not sought. No political campaign donations were accepted. Instead of campaigning, the focus was on education and action. Instead of events, county commissioner meetings were attended with the people. When invited to speak, Party operatives tried to influence the organizers. 

I ran on a single issue: to repair elections with a particular focus on the spider web of the electronic voting system that entangles alert and unsuspecting voters alike. 

It is a system with many features. Cheating can happen before and after the polls close. Absentee mail-in voting is out of control. Votes can be hijacked from people who didn't even vote. A ballot inserted into a tabulator won't necessarily read a voter's choices accurately. After unofficial results are in and after those unofficial results are made official through certifications at the county and then state canvassing boards, without properly checking the accuracy of the results, legitimate and proper audits—sometimes called full forensic audits—are avoided by the powers at be at all costs. 

Indeed, the attempts to block even basic questions being asked has alerted many, many more to the seriousness of the issue. So you're saying I can't ask questions, but you're also saying everything is fine? There's a moment in Star Wars: A New Hope, where, in the detention corridor command post Han Solo decides to blast the communication link because he wasn't able to answer the questions being asked. "Boring conversation anyway... LUKE, WE'RE GONNA HAVE COMPANY!"

To demonstrate that they had learned from the aftermath of 2020, in a massive show of transparency, only 1 of the 87 Minnesota counties even released the automatically-generated cast vote record (CVR) reports from Minnesota's August 9, 2022 primary election. (That was Chisago, who had promised to do this after admitting election records from 2020 were not retained the federally required 22 months.) 

Like any election, without a full forensic audit of ballots, ballot envelopes, election equipment, and registration systems, the integrity of the systems, process, and results can never be confirmed by the voters, which was reason enough for countries like Germany to do away with electronic voting equipment altogether. A friend asked me in early 2024: How unreliable do we want our elections to be?

Fifth graders, who cannot lawfully vote (yet), should be able to understand how votes are counted. In the future, God willing, they will, when this state and country return to manual hand counting and tallying of paper ballots in small, manageable precincts on election day. Mail-in voting will be outlawed and voters will have to show some form of identification to prove citizenship and local residence to receive a ballot. 

The simplicity of this overall approach, and its extremely low cost, when considering many have and will volunteer for such a service to their local city, town, or county, will make future generations frown in disbelief at how we even went down the insecure electronic road (combined with mass mail-in) and indeed how long it took to right the ship.

To distract from genuine reports from citizen journalists depicting this lack of transparency and obstruction of public data releases, election corruption deniers—starting with the mainstream media—endlessly parrot tired talking points. Safest and most secure! Not connected to the internet! A perfect election! So effective is their repetition that some come to believe their banal lies. 

So strange is this effect that it might be compared to Mr. Smith taking over a civilian's body in *The Matrix*. Most election clerks and auditors robotically claim they are following election law and election guides from the secretary of state—some making these remarks with a smirk on the edge of their mouths—while withholding basic data requested from their offices in violation of data practice laws. And still potential allies ask, Where's the proof? 

It's time to flip the table. 

Were there ever any actual problems with a simple hand count of paper ballots in small precincts? Was the purpose of more technology concentrated in a handful of companies really to make our elections *less* transparent? Less comprehensible? With databases like the voter rolls and registrations and poll worker data increasingly centralized in the hands of secretaries of state? (And in cases like Konnech, Inc., alleged to be stored on Chinese servers, whose product, PollChief, operates in cities like Minneapolis.)

Or could it be that the intricately connected companies and organizations comprising the election process like Runbeck, Dominion, ES&S, Scytl, Edison Research, ERIC, and Konnech be exactly what it looks like? In 1910 men representing a quarter of the planet's wealth [secretly met on Jekyll Island](https://rumble.com/v1cbydb-eustace-mullins-secrets-of-the-federal-reserve-speech.html) to prepare the way for The Federal Reserve Act of 1913, which Minnesota's Charles A. Lindbergh Sr. opposed, suggesting its passage meant selling the nation's children and grandchildren into slavery. 

The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 established a banking cartel. What we are witnessing now is the exposure of the election cartel and all its players. (As it turns out decisively connected to the banking cartel.) Their attempt to completely subvert elections was total and made [Bev Harris and Bennie Smith's Fraction Magic](https://t.me/erikmn/2206) look like child's play.

Many countries have already fallen to the election cartel's schemes in recent decades. Brazilians are fighting back with protests seeking military action. Americans are holding the line in places like Arizona with a different set of tools not available to Brazilians. It could be said we are doing it by the book. Which book? (Mark that down as a research question, dear reader.) America's 2020 and 2022 elections will not stand. Or maybe the entire thing was a setup? A learning experience? A chance for the people to step up and understand the profound ideas that this country was founded upon? A chance for We the People to reclaim control over our government?

At day's end the illusion of a functioning election process is just one of many programs to uninstall from society, alongside global financial controls like the Fed and central banks, medical tyranny orchestrated by the WHO, and the captivity instantiated by your USA Inc. birth certificate and social security number. 

This deprogramming and deconditioning is necessary because the current programming and conditioning enables the old guard through lower level participants who know not what they do and who often act without informed consent. 

It is remarkable that together We the People with guidance from God Almighty through Jesus's example (also known to some lovingly as Yeshua of Nazareth) and frequency have gotten this far without civilization level collapse. With active thermonuclear weapons for some decades, the war games have been touch and go for a while now. Staged and legitimate bio and information threats further complicate matters. Much is not as it seems. But since we the people are the news now, it's on us to get out there and not only record history, but make it.

No one said it would be easy to advance. But with the tools we have at our disposal, we can and we will.

The first edition of this book was written quickly and contained many mistakes. (The second edition edited in even less time.) Thankfully readers were forgiving and even shared it both with one another and with their county commissioners, making it an uncensorable resource for truth and an antidote to wilful ignorance and plausible deniability.

Following its publication for a time updates were made separately on the [Midwest Seeds newsletter](https://erikvanmechelen.substack.com).

My vantage point into the election system began in an investigative way. I was one of perhaps only a few dozen people at each of the Cyber Symposium in Sioux Falls, South Dakota in August 2021, The Moment of Truth Summit in Springfield, Missouri, August 2022, and the Election Crime Bureau in August 2023. From preparation for, participation in, and reflection on those multi-day events, I learned a great deal and realized how much more there was to learn. 

In the last year (2022) I have also attended county commissioner and township supervisor meetings in more Minnesota counties than anyone except Rick Weible. (There are those who have attended many more in aggregate, by consistently going to their local town, city, and county meetings.) These experiences provided national and local level angles of approach into local government oversight and transparency through the lense of the election apparatus. Even with this background, every day I am motivated to listen and learn even more, so that the most effective actions can be taken in the right order for lasting impact.

In this second edition, corrections have been made and updates are offered in the following areas: 

- repositioned the history of voting machines (Chapter 1)
- a clarification about cast vote records and ballot images (Chapter 6)
- added county-level field notes, observations, and suggestions from a few Minnesota counties, in particular for Stearns and Anoka (Chapter 6)
- added a new chapter, What We Can Do (Chapter 7)
- commentary on newly added or amended Minnesota Statutes (Chapter 7)
- anecdotes and snippets from meetings and conversations with grassroots leaders country-wide (throughout)
- moved the anecdote about living one year in Beijing (Appendix)
- included Susan Smith's post-trial brief relevant to all Minnesotans (Chapter 6) - [read the brief now right here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/crysjx7m3pae19bexqqpy/24-04-26-Smith-Post-Trial-Brief.pdf?rlkey=q7pwxrtuqgz83y2mc6iv428ow&dl=0)

One difference readers of the first edition will notice in the second is a bit lighter, aspirational tone, combined with a focus on empirical facts, as well as a healthy dose of wit. On this note, bear in mind the advice of Col. Jack O'Neill in the Stargate SG-1 series who warns against trusting those without a sense of humor. The shortcoming of communists and their henchmen and zealots is their inability to laugh and love like we do.

Having noted the role of humor, do not be persuaded that any of this is at its essence light-hearted. This section opens with a quote from the inventor of Project Apario for a reason. Andrei survived a communist orphanage in Rumania where 95% of his peers did not, instead ending up in the global organ harvesting and human supply chain. His "American Dream" childhood and reclaiming of his true name in his adulthood—breaking the chains of the Road to Evergreen's mind-controlling Stockholm Syndrome—allowed him to meet Yeshua and in short order complete the proof of concept research utility allowing all of us to perform advanced searches on declas and FOIA records from .mil and .gov sources like the JFK Files which the National Archives released in an unsearchable format further hiding truths about our government's 20th-century communist infiltration. 

It was no wonder that the opposition is doing all it can to prevent the biblical table flip on the idea of mainstream media that a worldwide decentralized truth repository represents. (The newer version of this has appeared as idoread.com)

May we all work together to end global communism, reduce its nefarious narratives to rubble, and in God's time find peace and happiness. 

As a mentor has said, the stories of these times will be told around the campfire, passed down from generation to generation. Please bear that in mind as what is shared in this book comes merely from my experience, a way to put my observations, recollections, and insights into readers hands. 

Therefore, do not take anything here as authoritative, as I am not an authority (nor am I an authoritarian), but rather take the information on board to consider and to verify for yourself. 

It's been quite the journey hasn't it?

The best is yet to come.

God's children are not for sale.

Minnesota will be revived.

God bless you,
