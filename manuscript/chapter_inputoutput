# An Input/Output System

Elections can be described as an input/output system. 

Inputs include voter registration, ballots, and counts/tallies. 

The main output is the reported results. 

Expanding this slightly to include the administrative process, we have the following six elements: 

1) voter registration, 
2) absentee ballots, 
3) election day, 
4) election night, 
5) reporting, and 
6) auditing. 

Expand on these briefly.
