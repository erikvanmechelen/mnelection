9/11/2001 landed on my 14th birthday. Unlike many American kids, who were shown the images of the planes striking the towers over and over in school, for me, school was cancelled. Still, half a world away, in Jakarta, Indonesia, I watched. 

A few years later, when the United States military forces went to Iraq, my Pakistani and Indian classmates paused their debate over the Cricket World Cup to commentate on the real reasons the Americans were meddling in foreign territory. 

President Trump was the first Commander in Chief since John F. Kennedy to attempt to disrupt the regime which has for so long benefitted from endless foreign wars and as a result maintained their grip on power.

This regime is presently losing its stranglehold. One needs only take a walk along the neighborhood street to appreciate what is changing. Peace, the kind of peace the 35th President of the United States spoke about on June 10, 1963, is not only possible in our lifetimes, but it can and will last for a long, long time. Even as it seems a great reckoning is upon us, for me, peace is there waiting for us.

When I returned from China to Minnesota in 2006 I did not know that I would live in this state for the next 17 years. Nor did I know I would live in three parts of Minneapolis and decide to stay when I could easily have skipped town. Nor did I know that I would become so interested in restoring trustworthiness to elections as a starting point toward once again taking part in a path to peace here and for the entire planet.
