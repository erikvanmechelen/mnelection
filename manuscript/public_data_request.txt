Commissioner Conley,

Given recent revelations regarding Konnech Inc. leading to arrest of its CEO Eugene Yu, I am proposing an agenda item to discuss the appropriateness of Minneapolis's recent extension of Contract No. C-40044 with Konnech, Inc.

Hennepin County would not be the first to consider or reconsider its contract. You can learn more about this very important matter here:
https://kanekoa.substack.com/p/konnech-ceo-eugene-yus-ties-to-ccp

As Child Well-being Advisory Committee Chair, you may also be interested to know that Konnech has connections into school systems in the United States meaning the CCP likely has sensitive data on children, parents, teachers, and administrators. http://www.schoolbrief.com/schoolcase.html

Including on this email council members Robin Wonsley, LaTrisha Vetaw, Jason Chavez, and Emily Koski who made up the 4-member quorum present to approve the amendment to Contract No. C-40044 which extended and expanded the contract, as well as on that day absent council members Jeremiah Ellison and Andrew Johnson.

Thanks,
Erik van Mechelen

30? days go by, no response from Minneapolis, but they were not addressed in initial email.

Realized need to formalize my ask: 

-initial contract
-proper vetting (internal communications)

"Services to be performed are coordination with
City personnel relating to the successful implementation of a new Elections System, as well as
the successful transfer of data from the Cityâ€™s current program to the new system."

What was the new Elections System?
What does transfer of data look like? 

"The Cityâ€™s Elections Management System is at a crossroads. The current system does not meet
the needs of Elections and Voter Service."

How was this determined? 

"A significant investment from both Information
Technology (IT) and Elections would be needed to add the required functionality to the existing
system."

What is the "required functionality"?

https://lims.minneapolismn.gov/Download/PriorFileDocument/-63781/WCMSP-186604.PDF

In April 2015, Information Technology and City Clerkâ€™s Office issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the design, implementation and support of a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) Elections Management System, along with ancillary software and services. After a thorough vetting, Konnech was the awarded vendor for this system. 

Based upon the recent primary election, additional enhancements were found necessary to be implemented before the November 2016 general election. These enhancements will allow for better reporting, improved training functionality, tracking the core volunteers, and gaining staffing efficiencies.

Describe the "thorough vetting" process.
Expand on "tracking the core volunteers".
Point or provide evidence for "improved training functionality".


https://lims.minneapolismn.gov/RCA/1029

"Customizations are necessary to better match the business processes and the laws that govern the election process and allow greater enhancement of the application to better align this software.  In addition, mobile apps and greater reporting functions are available that were outside the original scope that will help streamline the business processes."

Describe "customizations are necessary".
Expand on "mobile apps and greater reporting functions".

zoom in on areas 



data set comes in 
16 files
2 for each CD 
first file is voter registration data
2nd is voter history, well over 1M records

take 2 independently, filter out voter histories for elections i want 

3.6M records for registrations 

can also filter out 
walk lists based upon election areas 

multiple datasets

database to crunch 

11/23 - 12/21 - did voters get removed... 

have records, more i have, closer to when they actually voted 
if there is voter history already pegged for them 

lokken, you can't rely on that data 

could give cleaner data 

you can see your own voter history as it has changed throughout election cycle

can see voter history of how 

they can see status changes of voter... 

but we can only see slices, access (limited heavily)
