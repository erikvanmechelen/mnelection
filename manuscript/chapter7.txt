# 2022 in Minnesota

*"These people don't understand."*

—Isabelle, shortly after having mic taken away from her as delegate to state convention, whose mom and dad lost everything in communist Ecuador

*"Did you by chance see the second round results?"*

*"I, um, no, because we knew they were good. But I'm not going to worry about the results right now. Right now I'm just going to chill with my family."*

—Part of a conversation between the author and Kelly soon after her concession speech

quote from isabel?

Isabelle,
from Ecuador
communism, mom and dad lost everything
she wanted to speak about the machines
it possibly was "out of order"
so she was asked to stop speaking
she went back to her seat, clearly distraught
i went a few sections over to her, looking for her make america great again hat
found her, crying
i said she did the right thing
to speak the truth
then she told me
people here don't understand
what don't they understand?
what's going to happen
tells me story of mom and dad


Will be critical and ask questions.

helped get legislators to cyber symposium
even got meeting with Eric Mortensen with Dr. Douglas Frank
apparently ball was in Frank's court and didn't follow up with Mortensen
unfortunate because when I spoke with Mortensen about it in late April, 2022, at the CD3 convention (I was there doing recon, hoping to speak with Kim and Kelly as I weighed the decision to run for secretary of state)
Mortensen seemed to still have a bad taste in his mouth about it
but the reality was there were great presenations and info shared
like this one (parable of the traffickers, which has been shown to be correct in spirit through the work of True the Vote's Katherine Engelbrecht and Gregg Phillips, showcased in 2000 mules )
or this talk from phil waldron, etc.
or this one looking at the before / after image (Tina Peters) now subject of
the [S]election Code (selectioncode.com) docuementary.
so
it is too bad that in my opinion we haven't heard much from these folks
i donated to lucero at the launch of the child protection Something (that michelle lentz invited me to)
and told him i was at the cyber symposium
because he only vaguely recalled speaking with me there
where he seemed a bit nervous that I was a writer
"I still don't work for anyone" i said,
i said thank you for keeping election integrity in mind
but he didn't share more about his plans there
and this legislative session was sorely lacking
^
do i need to be this critical, only if they actually haven't said anything.

the truth is the commissioners need spine, that can help

but need constituents
need legislators
need judges
need executive branch

all have to have spine, principles, courage

Because without access to information, how can the public make informed decisions? How can you give informed consent? How can you live in the truth if you aren't aware of it?

project veritas, focus on somali community
bigger story is 2000 mules
videographer tells me they are trying to connect to culture
pull stories often after they've done much work on them
fundraising emails and letters:
we want to cover election fraud, but we need more money
where are the stories about election machines?
(robert barnes - desantis doesn't have an election fraud problem)

put all the stories from CD5 show

clay county
michelle benson's son
Paul "Hold the Line" Gazelka
Eric "Dems stopped all our election integrity bills" Lucero
Glenn "I wrote the voter id bill" Gruenhagen
^
look for press releases about the cyber symposium.


to add, edwin's cease and desist letter to david haan?


or, put conversation in body... and find another quote for up here...

quote from kelly at convention?

no i didn't, but i'm sure it's good...

really?

## Preparation for 2022 in Minnesota

It matters a lot which candidates are on the ballot for a primary or general election. Imagine if Jeb Bush or Ted Cruz had faced off against Hillary Clinton, instead of Donald Trump. In that event, some percentage of republican voters may have stayed home. Unexciting candidates have that effect. If voters stay home a vote can be cast in their stead through real-time monitoring in the manner already described in the Attack Phase.

The method of putting forward unexciting candidates is also effective in state and local elections. As the media tries to get us talking about a red wave, we must stay vigilant and put forward America First candidates. That also requires that America First candidates stand up and join races. It does no one any good to elect candidates who can be influenced away from the principles of upholding the constitution.

QUOTED FROM OPENING OF THIS CHAPTER
In the psychological realm, in mid-2020, George Floyd dominated news cycles. Covid-19 was also a daily discussion topic on and offline. This provided distraction, air cover, and justification for procedural changes which flew in the face of existing Minnesota law.

Just as there were distractions in 2020, in the runup to the 2022 midterm elections, there has been no shortage of diversions attempted by those who wish to keep us from reclaiming our government.

This Rasmussen survey shows what voters care about versus what the media cares about:

![61% Very Concerned About Election Integrity](ras_survey.png)

Back in February, the beginning of the election process started in Minnesota at the precinct caucuses.

There, the key item of business is electing delegates. Those chosen in their precincts will then serve as delegates at the basic political organizing unit (BPOU) level. From there, another round of voting happens to elect delegates to the congressional district and state conventions, where endorsements occur for governor, attorney general, state auditor, and secretary of state.

In a world where most republican voters understood how to get involved starting in the precinct caucuses, this system has a chance to reliably produce solid candidates. That hasn't happened in the past. I too was a first timer and gradually learned how in practice the delegate selection process and ultimatly endorsements are a carefully crafted and heavily influenced outcome.

The Party says it wants to support endorsed candidates and discourages coverage of non-endorsed candidates. Meanwhile, the MNGOP has shown in reality it doesn't fully respect its own endorsements. For example, [Mark Bishofksy](https://markformnhouse.com/), endorsed candidate for 33B who single-handedly kickstarted the [Stop the Mandate](https://stopthemandatemn.org/) movement and hosted medical freedom rallies with thousands at the Capitol, is facing a challenger arguably more liked by the MNGOP leadership. But what I've observed is that the MNGOP works very hard to control who eventually becomes an endorsed candidate, even pulling stunts to avoid the endorsement of candidates like Nathan Wesenberg that are a threat to their current grip on power.

-summary point - chair calls paper ballot, saboteurs
-summary point - electronic voting devices, lol
-...
-was there vote shaving w/ Padgett? (Munson quote from Jamie?)
-kim/kelly no endorsement in my opinion OR kelly was asked to step aside and did so
-endorsements run on electronic voting equipment with no transparent verification (COMPARE David Haan's emails prior with what they did/didn't do at convention... and Neil Shah asks for audits, receives no response)
-calls for unity... but chair does not model this behavior... instead trying to silence free speech lol

-my story so far...
-given incorrect info by my own bpou chair:
-...no money
-...stiff competition
-...cd8 says to mark, don't have me on
-...diana friemann, olmsted gop pushback
-all this to be expected because secretary of state is a crucial role for establishment to own - look at the behavior of secretaries of state across the nation - how many seem to care about the election coup? how many have demonstrated through decisive actions how they care about it? (see New Mexico... provide links to David Clements' work, incestuous, etc.)
-part of reason you must share this free book
-because the information must get to those who are curious to know, to those who weren't at precinct, bpou, and state conventions, but who as citizens have a right to know


## The Delegate Selection Process

Right from the jump, there were issues at the precinct caucuses. [Numerous reports of tampering](https://saveminnesota.org) suggested delegate lists were being changed either at the BPOU level or the state level (or both). Unless an audit was done, reconciling the eyewitness and documented accounts would be difficult. No audits were done.

Seeing how the confirmed reports were handled, I couldn't help wondering how many more delegate list incidents went unnoticed and therefore unreported. I emailed my BPOU Chair about this to see whether our lists could be confirmed.

![Feb 16 email to my BPOU Chair](diane_feb16_1.png)

Diane responded suggesting this happened because of previous delegates somehow  including previous delegate attendees. When she suggests "that was the bulk of the problem" it indicates to me that she was aware of the larger issue bubbling up in other areas.

I responded the next day.

![Feb 17 email to my BPOU Chair](diane_caucus.png)

Her response doesn't answer all my questions and suggests she was taking direction from the state party.

![Feb 17 reply from my BPOU Chair](diane_caucus3.png)

I sent one more email which did not recieve a reply.

![Feb 18, to BPOU Chair](diane_feb18)

What I'd already learned about Morrison County combined with this exchange had me wondering: How many delegates at BPOU conventions, endorsing conventions, and finally the state convention would ultimately be illegitimate?

For just one example that soon emerged, consider the [delegate lists from Otter Tail County](https://saveminnesota.org/otter-tail/f/otter-tail-report-election-tampering-in-10-precincts).

![Otter Tail Delegate List Discrepancies](otter_tail_delegates.png)

From [this detailed report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Mq8vRXwOQTw9ZsQQCm3MRIYwrD_khx10/view) it was discovered that "two individuals whose eligibility is in question, were elected at the March 19th County Convention to represent the county at the State and Congressional District Conventions – one as a delegate, the other as an alternate." The opening sentence of the conclusion of this report reads: "If caucus precinct delegations have been systemically altered, it would appear to undermine the foundational integrity of our democratic process."

Having reviewed some of [these reports](https://saveminnesota.org) and having spoken with dozens of people about delegate lists from across the state, including people like Nathan Wesenberg [in this conversation](https://soundcloud.com/user-191695017/caucus-conventions-and-corruption-in-the-mngop-with-nathan-wesenberg-part-1-of-2), my gut feeling says that perhaps as much as 12-15% of state convention delegates in Rochester were not legitimate. Remember, this could be more *or* less, but since BPOUs and the party were not able to demonstrate reconciliation of the lists, we may never know.

The lack of a tight yet transparent chain of custody of the data is as much an issue with these lists as it is with our votes cast at conventions or in primary or general elections.

![Counties Affected So Far - saveminnesota.org](save_minnesota_counties.png)

Even if we conservatively speculated that only about 1 state delegate per county (87 counties) should not have been included (replacing someone else), then that would represent a large voting bloc shift. If only about 100 people were replaced, that is a potential swing of a net 200 votes, about a 10% swing as there were about 2,200 seated casting votes for the endorsing segments in Rochester. Of course, no one is duty bound to vote for one candidate or another in advance, but if it is true that delegates were being replaced—and that has been shown to be the case—why was that being done?

From one point of view, the result is equivalent to inflating voter rolls (in the statewide voter registration system). From another vantage point, the result is equivalent to a [vote swap in an election management system](https://rumble.com/vgi89t-hacking-democracy-antrim-county-mi-edition.html).

## Endorsing Conventions

*"Did you by chance see the second round results?"*

My Precinct,
almost wasn't a delegate
missed the pre-signup, and only got onto list to be considered with a few minutes to spare by leaving my seat, going across the room, and asking my BPOU Chair Diana. There was a printed list to which I added my handwritten name. Several others, also apparently unaware of how to get their names on that list previously, saw me walk over and also did so to get their names written down for consideration. the list was 12 people and jumped to about 19. each of us gave 30 second speeches as to why we should become delegates.

Carleton's lol speech


CD5
miscount first round (this had happened while i was observing counting in precinct where I would have been shortchanged 1 vote had I not been paying attention and called it out)

miscount would have given Cicely Davis the 60% threshold in the first round. But that was inaccurate, and she didn't quite make it.

so after short speeches, Shukri? concedes and says she will help Cicely

one person in my bpou had left (he was unsure about cicely and may have voted for Royce)

this time, 75% of total for cicely

had royce offended some of the delegates? perhaps

but what he said, i think, would have rung true with the general republican voting population, as well as independents and democrats who are tired of the deteriorating state and country


### State Convention

#### Not Accomodated in Endorsement Process

I announced [my decision to run for secretary of state](https://rumble.com/v13i4tm-mn-secretary-of-state-announcement.html) on May 3, 2022, standing on the back of a pickup truck in the Sherburne County Government Center parking lot, ahead of a County Commissioners Board meeting where Sherburne county residents were making the case to the commissioners to put election integrity on the agenda (short of an agenda item, there is a limited number of speakers and time, three minutes per speaker, in open forum).

Then I emailed several of the MNGOP leadership. Realizing that the convention would start nine days later, I wanted to do everything I could to be included and reduce any extra effort I would cause having entered later than Kim and Kelly.

When I didn't hear back, I contacted my BPOU Chair Diana.

1 email

2 email

On May 4th, I got a call back from Donna Bergstrom. I said I was thankful for her help and she said, "That's what we're here for."

When I wasn't copied on emails Donna said she would send to get the process rolling, I called her back the next day. She said to Executive Director of the MNGOP, Mike Longergan at mj@mngop.com.

The following emails Mike Lonergan have apparently been deleted on Mike's end, as shown by the [2] instead of the [4] in my Protonmail email client—the emails are no longer viewable in my Protonmail account. (But for once I have Facebook to thank for saving them because I posted them there previously.)

I watched the secretary of state speeches from the alternates balcony. I'd gone up to meet a friend of a friend. It was a useful vantage point to take in the spectacle. That's what the state convention could be reduced to, in a word. But the use of spectacle as a *tactic* was also demonstrated ...

speakers... flashing lights... music...

something was missing... no mention of election fraud

neither secretary of state candidate used the words stolen election or election fraud. there was one mention of ensuring computers not be connected to the internet, but that was the only mention of machines. no other comments on electronic voting equipment or the larger modern electronic voting system.

that was a bit depressing but it emphasized to me that there was work right in front of me to do.

Kim didn't get the endorsement in the first round, ending up a few percentage points shy of the required 60%. So all the delegates voted again. I voted no endorsement twice because I couldn't vote for a candidate that hadn't acknowledged the stolen election nor emphasized the necessity to minimize voter fraud going forward, including by supporting the removal of cheat machines.

After the roughly ten minute delay from the votes going through to the MNGOP putting them up on the screen, I was surprised *not* to see the results displayed; instead, Kelly came out, thanked her volunteers, and conceded. Since I voted, and so did over 2,000 delegates, I wanted to know the result of the election.

God helped me catch up with both Kelly and Kim right after Kelly's concession speeach.

senate district
nathan's story... didn't finish counting, then wrapped it up... wow...

i will focus on the state convention here, since i was there

not as endorsed candidate, but as a delegate

having received the 4th-most votes (after the chair, husband of chair, and secretary) after in 30 seconds saying election integrity is my number one issue and i want to vote for candidates that have courage and dedication to the truth

carleton, hennepin county, stands up and says let's support those who have put in the work. not exactly a welcoming comment to the many new people who are getting involved because they don't like what they've been seeing.





Link to soundcloud...

As precinct caucuses ca

all this amounts to...

there have also been reports of tampering with the precinct delegate process and possible influence operations to position establishment candidates for the MNGOP endorsement.

We'll see, primaries are tbh the big thing and there are already issues there and in republican leadership conferences

ALL OF THIS EQUIVALENT TO INFLATING VOTER ROLLS (WITH ILLEGITIMATE VOTERS)
ALL OF THIS IS EQUIVALENT TO STUFFING BALLOT BOX

If this can happen in Otter Tail County, it can happen in any county in Minnesota. This was why some were calling for a full and transparent audit of all county delegate lists to compare with state lists prior to further BPOU and endorsing conventions. These audits did not satisfyingly occur.

I asked my BPOU Chair for an audit and the request was declined.

In Morrison County,
listen to Nathan Wesenberg's reporting

ALL OF THIS EQUIVALENT TO INFLATING VOTER ROLLS (WITH ILLEGITIMATE VOTERS)
ALL OF THIS IS EQUIVALENT TO STUFFING BALLOT BOX

EVEN A 15% TAMPERING WOULD HAVE A 30% EFFECT SIZE - JUST LIKE VOTE SWAPPING IN AN ELECTION, IF I TAKE A TRUMP VOTE AND SWAP TO BIDE, -1 TO TRUMP, +1 TO BIDEN, OR NET +2

IF YOU WERE TAMPERING WITH LISTS, YOU WERE PUTTING PEOPLE ON LIST WHO YOU **KNEW** WOULD VOTE YOUR DIRECTION, CHOOSING THE DELEGATE INSTEAD OF LETTING THEM BE VOTED UPON AS IN THE RULES AND MNGOP CONSTITUTION AND BPOU RULES, ETC.

senate district 10 endorsement convention cancelled

edwin hahn barred from senate 4 endorsement convention and participation in state convention as a delegate

who knows how many more this may have occurred to if people had spoken up about what they were seeing

erik van mechelen not allowed to participate in state convention endorsement process for secretary of state (link to video/article)
https://erikvanmechelen.substack.com/p/proposed-rule-29-to-prevent-new-sos

governor's asked to write on a sign, one word, jerk, loser, problem, take photo to persaude them to accept endorsement

according to the electronic devices at the convention, about 55% were new people, but how many *more* people should there have been without tampering? there was no transparent audit done of the statewide delegate lists which should have been done to ensure no one was left out of the process

letter from chairman david haan, calls anyone asking for paper ballots, SABOTEURS
any campaign can ask and get the next day.

at convention, another speech meant to dissuade people from standing for paper ballots - it will take too long, etc.

i asked the yellow shirted guy how things were going, who i could ask questions to about process, he pointed to the people on the stage... the mngop leadership.

then we use electronic devices, don't show many of the results.

in sos race i asked kim and kelly, neither was able to share what the result of the 2nd round was, so i'm left wondering whether kim even reached the 60% threshold. i asked eric lucero if it was normal not to show the final results, and he said it was

that may be 'how things are done' but at least in the general election we were told that Biden received 81 million votes and didn't have to take someone's word for it that he beat Trump handily.

devices used at MNGOP state convention in Rochester
https://erikvanmechelen.substack.com/p/electronic-voting-devices-used-at

remember this - https://erikformn.us/action.html

Shah's campaign asked for audits, no answer from the party.

all this is part of election process

who wins primary becomes the party candidate, and republican candidate or democrat candidate usually win, since most voters have been funneled (through decades of influence operations) into supporting the candidate that their party puts forward.

in the recent past, as the Democrat party has moved further to the left ideologically, part of the uniparty strategy seems to be to endorse and run Republican candidates that are fairly weak and unexciting, like for example 'Low Energy Jeb'. This way, low propensity republican voters will stay home in greater numbers opening the door to the Attack Phase where mail-in ballots are submitted for them.

(Low-Energy Jeb...so low energy that I once contributed to a USA Today article... and Governor Terry McAuliffe, recently defeated by now Governor Glenn Youngkin, supposedly a win for Republicans, but in my opinion Youngkin is likely a Republican in disguise and a suitable poster child for the false assertion that in machine-driven elections the algorithms can be easily overwhelmed)
https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/05/28/jeb-bush-terry-mcauliffe-invest-workers-spur-economic-recovery-column/5259291002/
Knowing what I know now, I wouldn't do work for them again.

the endorsement is used as a marketing badge to signal

but in this environment, if a candidate could only have one, would they rather have the endorsement of their party or an endorsement from President Trump? (but also, lets not read too much into every Trump endorsement)

having seen how the party puts forward candidates, i am embarrassed. embarrassed that i previously mindlessly just voted for the candidates and was not involved in helping to choose them

also, open Primary, in Georgia, about 7% of voters in the republican primary were democrats
check this:
Congressional and state primaries: Open partisan w/ nonpartisan registration
note:
MN
    Minnesota has nonpartisan registration. There is no option to affiliate with a political party on the voter registration form.

## Endorsements

this could also happen in the minnesota primary on august 9 for select races

I think I understand your frustration with Wardlow apparently going back on his word.

In my opinion Wardlow should not have agreed to honor the endorsement: However if he had said that, likely that admission would have been used against him as well.

How *should* he have played it?

Maybe he could have learned from how Trump answered when asked in his debate vs. Biden.

Trump said if the election is fair, I’ll accept it, but if there’s fraud, I won’t.

Instead of giving a Yes/No answer which can be used against him.

Jesus, when asked if taxes should be paid to Ceasar:

Give unto Ceasar what is Ceaser’s, give unto God what is God’s.

Neil Shah asked for audits of the Rochester state convention results, which David Haan explicitly said would be available to any campaign after the convention. No response from MNGOP.

I don’t have a good feeling at all about how MNGOP ran state convention.

Am writing a bit about this in the short free book that will be ready in coming weeks.
