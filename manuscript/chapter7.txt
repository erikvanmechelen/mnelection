# 2022 in Minnesota

*"These people don't understand."*

—Isabelle, shortly after having mic taken away from her as delegate to state convention while speaking about electronic voting machines, whose mom and dad lost everything in communist Ecuador

*"Did you by chance see the second round results?"*

*"I, um, no, because we knew they were good. But I'm not going to worry about the results right now. Right now I'm just going to chill with my family."*

—Part of a conversation between the author and Kelly soon after her concession speech

***

A decent amount of my preparation for 2022 actually occurred starting around age 16 when I was introduced by my history teacher in Houston, Texas, to the Game of Diplomacy.

versions of all these tricks i'd seen before...

diplomacy, club, apparently of of JFK's (link to project apario) favorite games

a game i enjoyed so much that I formed a club and later wrote [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Diplomacy-Conversations-Erik-van-Mechelen-ebook/dp/B07ZZMVCGR/) and recorded [an audiobook](https://www.amazon.com/Diplomacy-Conversations-Face-Face-Tournaments/dp/B08742MPJJ/)

cheating is allowed in the rules

intense

because narratives and alliances and strategic movements must sometimes be developed carefully over a handful of game years (one to two hours) - one wrong move, mistep, or miscalculation can undo that preparation or end the game for you

in a high stakes moment during a tournament game in chicago in 2019, i was physically pushed

i decided not to complain - turn the other cheek

later i noticed the man who pushed me went to let the tournament organizer know what happened - that's what was supposed to happen from a sportsmanship perspective, even in that game where the rules specifically state there are no rules (therefore, house rules have to be developed by game hosts, leagues, and tournament organizers)

quote from isabel?

Isabelle,
from Ecuador
communism, mom and dad lost everything
she wanted to speak about the machines
it possibly was "out of order"
so she was asked to stop speaking
she went back to her seat, clearly distraught
i went a few sections over to her, looking for her make america great again hat
found her, crying
i said she did the right thing
to speak the truth
then she told me
people here don't understand
what don't they understand?
what's going to happen
tells me story of mom and dad


Will be critical and ask questions.

helped get legislators to cyber symposium
even got meeting with Eric Mortensen with Dr. Douglas Frank
apparently ball was in Frank's court and didn't follow up with Mortensen
unfortunate because when I spoke with Mortensen about it in late April, 2022, at the CD3 convention (I was there doing recon, hoping to speak with Kim and Kelly as I weighed the decision to run for secretary of state)
Mortensen seemed to still have a bad taste in his mouth about it
but the reality was there were great presenations and info shared
like this one (parable of the traffickers, which has been shown to be correct in spirit through the work of True the Vote's Katherine Engelbrecht and Gregg Phillips, showcased in 2000 mules )
or this talk from phil waldron, etc.
or this one looking at the before / after image (Tina Peters) now subject of
the [S]election Code (selectioncode.com) docuementary.
so
it is too bad that in my opinion we haven't heard much from these folks
i donated to lucero at the launch of the child protection Something (that michelle lentz invited me to)
and told him i was at the cyber symposium
because he only vaguely recalled speaking with me there
where he seemed a bit nervous that I was a writer
"I still don't work for anyone" i said,
i said thank you for keeping election integrity in mind
but he didn't share more about his plans there
and this legislative session was sorely lacking
^
do i need to be this critical, only if they actually haven't said anything.

the truth is the commissioners need spine, that can help

but need constituents
need legislators
need judges
need executive branch

all have to have spine, principles, courage

Because without access to information, how can the public make informed decisions? How can you give informed consent? How can you live in the truth if you aren't aware of it?

project veritas, focus on somali community
bigger story is 2000 mules
videographer tells me they are trying to connect to culture
pull stories often after they've done much work on them
fundraising emails and letters:
we want to cover election fraud, but we need more money
where are the stories about election machines?
(robert barnes - desantis doesn't have an election fraud problem)

put all the stories from CD5 show

clay county
michelle benson's son
Paul "Hold the Line" Gazelka
Eric "Dems stopped all our election integrity bills" Lucero
Glenn "I wrote the voter id bill" Gruenhagen
^
look for press releases about the cyber symposium.


to add, edwin's cease and desist letter to david haan?


or, put conversation in body... and find another quote for up here...

quote from kelly at convention?

no i didn't, but i'm sure it's good...

really?

Why would you let endorsements replace your critical thinking?

A lot of people trusted Dr. Fauci's endorsement of various protocols and treatments who now regret substituting their God-given ability to think (and intuit) for a man's misguided opinion.

Don't make this mistake with regard to supporting candidates. Even if your chosen candidate loses... rigged machines, at least you will have not put your energy and effort...

The power of your words and decisions are not to be underestimated.

Fortunately, this year it is easier than ever to recognize whether a candidate is truly America First. Have they consistently said the election was stolen? Do they boldly speak the truth on the basic constitutional topics like gun rights, medical freedom, and CRT? Are they willing to respond to tough questions? And maybe most important: Have they already been working toward the outcomes they say they want to continue working on once in office? What tangible proof can they show of those efforts?

## Preparation for 2022 in Minnesota

It matters a lot which candidates are on the ballot for a primary or general election. Imagine if Jeb Bush or Ted Cruz had faced off against Hillary Clinton, instead of Donald Trump. In that dystopia, some percentage of republican voters may have stayed home and Hillary would likely have won easily. Unexciting candidates lead to low legitimate turnout. But if voters stay home a vote can be cast in their stead through real-time monitoring in the manner already described in the Attack Phase.

The method of putting forward unexciting candidates is also effective in state and local elections. As the media tries to get us talking about a red wave, we must stay vigilant and put forward America First candidates. That also requires that America First candidates stand up and join races. It does no one any good to elect candidates who can be influenced away from the principles of upholding the constitution when the enemy is no longer at the gates but is fully occupying our territory.





QUOTED FROM OPENING OF THIS CHAPTER
In the psychological realm, in mid-2020, George Floyd dominated news cycles. Covid-19 was also a daily discussion topic on and offline. This provided distraction, air cover, and justification for procedural changes which flew in the face of existing Minnesota law.

Just as there were distractions in 2020, in the runup to the 2022 midterm elections, there has been no shortage of diversions attempted by those who wish to keep us from reclaiming our government.

This Rasmussen survey shows what voters care about versus what the media cares about:

![61% Very Concerned About Election Integrity](ras_survey.png)

Back in February, the beginning of the election process started in Minnesota at the precinct caucuses.

There, the key item of business is electing delegates. Those chosen in their precincts will then serve as delegates at the basic political organizing unit (BPOU) level. From there, another round of voting happens to elect delegates to the congressional district and state conventions, where endorsements occur for governor, attorney general, state auditor, and secretary of state.

In a world where most republican voters understood how to get involved starting in the precinct caucuses, this system has a chance to reliably produce solid candidates. That hasn't happened in the past. I too was a first timer and gradually learned how in practice the delegate selection process and ultimatly endorsements are a carefully crafted and heavily influenced outcome.

The Party says it wants to support endorsed candidates and discourages coverage of non-endorsed candidates. Meanwhile, the MNGOP has shown in reality it doesn't fully respect its own endorsements. For example, [Mark Bishofksy](https://markformnhouse.com/), endorsed candidate for 33B who single-handedly kickstarted the [Stop the Mandate](https://stopthemandatemn.org/) movement and hosted medical freedom rallies with thousands at the Capitol, is facing a challenger arguably more liked by the MNGOP leadership. But what I've observed is that the MNGOP works very hard to control who eventually becomes an endorsed candidate, even pulling stunts to avoid the endorsement of candidates like Nathan Wesenberg that are a threat to their current grip on power.

-summary point - chair calls paper ballot, saboteurs
-summary point - electronic voting devices, lol
-...
-was there vote shaving w/ Padgett? (Munson quote from Jamie?)
-kim/kelly no endorsement in my opinion OR kelly was asked to step aside and did so
-endorsements run on electronic voting equipment with no transparent verification (COMPARE David Haan's emails prior with what they did/didn't do at convention... and Neil Shah asks for audits, receives no response)
-calls for unity... but chair does not model this behavior... instead trying to silence free speech lol

-my story so far...
-given incorrect info by my own bpou chair:
-...no money
-...stiff competition
-...cd8 says to mark, don't have me on
-...diana friemann, olmsted gop pushback
-all this to be expected because secretary of state is a crucial role for establishment to own - look at the behavior of secretaries of state across the nation - how many seem to care about the election coup? how many have demonstrated through decisive actions how they care about it? (see New Mexico... provide links to David Clements' work, incestuous, etc.)
-part of reason you must share this free book
-because the information must get to those who are curious to know, to those who weren't at precinct, bpou, and state conventions, but who as citizens have a right to know


## The Delegate Selection Process

Right from the jump, there were issues at the precinct caucuses. [Numerous reports of tampering](https://saveminnesota.org) suggested delegate lists were being changed either at the BPOU level or the state level (or both). Unless an audit was done, reconciling the eyewitness and documented accounts would be difficult. No audits were done.

Seeing how the confirmed reports were handled, I couldn't help wondering how many more delegate list incidents went unnoticed and therefore unreported. I emailed my BPOU Chair about this to see whether our lists could be confirmed.

![Feb 16 email to my BPOU Chair](diane_feb16_1.png)

Diane responded suggesting this happened because of previous delegates somehow  including previous delegate attendees.

![The bulk of the problem](diane_caucus_feb16_2.png)

When she suggests "that was the bulk of the problem" it indicates to me that she was aware of the larger issue bubbling up in other areas. And why would other BPOUs have included previous caucus attendees on their lists? Only delegates elected at the precinct caucuses become delegates or alternates. Having previously been on a delegate list does not qualify someone to be a delegate in the future.

I responded the next day.

![A request for more transparency](diane_caucus.png)

Her response doesn't answer all my questions and suggests she was taking direction from the state party.

![Feb 17 reply from my BPOU Chair](diane_caucus3.png)

I sent one more email which did not recieve a reply.

![Feb 18 to BPOU Chair](diane_feb18.png)

What I'd already learned about [what took place in Morrison County](https://soundcloud.com/user-191695017/caucus-conventions-and-corruption-in-the-mngop-with-nathan-wesenberg-part-1-of-2) combined with this exchange had me wondering: How many delegates at BPOU conventions, endorsing conventions, and finally the state convention would ultimately be illegitimate?

For just one example that soon emerged, consider the [delegate lists from Otter Tail County](https://saveminnesota.org/otter-tail/f/otter-tail-report-election-tampering-in-10-precincts).

![Otter Tail Delegate List Discrepancies](otter_tail_delegates.png)

From [this detailed report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Mq8vRXwOQTw9ZsQQCm3MRIYwrD_khx10/view) it was discovered that "two individuals whose eligibility is in question, were elected at the March 19th County Convention to represent the county at the State and Congressional District Conventions – one as a delegate, the other as an alternate." The opening sentence of the conclusion of this report reads: "If caucus precinct delegations have been systemically altered, it would appear to undermine the foundational integrity of our democratic process."

Having reviewed some of [these reports](https://saveminnesota.org) and having spoken with dozens of people about delegate lists from across the state, including people like Nathan Wesenberg [in this conversation](https://soundcloud.com/user-191695017/caucus-conventions-and-corruption-in-the-mngop-with-nathan-wesenberg-part-1-of-2), my gut feeling says that perhaps as much as 12-15% of state convention delegates in Rochester were not legitimate. Remember, this could be more *or* less, but since BPOUs and the party were not able to demonstrate reconciliation of the lists, we may never know.

The lack of a tight yet transparent chain of custody of the data is as much an issue with these lists as it is with our votes cast at conventions or in primary or general elections.

![Counties Affected So Far - saveminnesota.org](save_minnesota_counties.png)

Even if we conservatively speculated that only about 1 state delegate per county (87 counties) should not have been included (replacing someone else), then that would represent a large voting bloc shift. If only about 100 people were replaced, that is a potential swing of a net 200 votes, about a 10% swing as there were about 2,200 seated casting votes for the endorsing segments in Rochester. Of course, no one is duty bound to vote for one candidate or another in advance, but if it is true that delegates were being replaced—and that has been shown to be the case—why was that being done?

From one point of view, the result is equivalent to inflating voter rolls (in the statewide voter registration system). From another vantage point, the result is equivalent to a [vote swap in an election management system](https://rumble.com/vgi89t-hacking-democracy-antrim-county-mi-edition.html).

## Endorsing Conventions

Endorsing conventions allow the MNGOP to select an "endorsed" candidate, who will get to carry that badge forward. These conventions happen at the senate district, congressional district, and state level.

How do you get to participate and vote in these conventions?

By becoming a delegate.

Starting at the precinct level, then the BPOU level (Basic Political Organizing Unit), then the congressional district and finally the state convention.

At each stage you may nominate yourself and then your peers must elect you to move forward.

Eventually, a bit over 2,000 delegates make their way to the state convention to select the endorsed candidates for state auditor, secretary of state, attorney general, and governor.

Candidates can still run as republicans in the primary elections, this year happening on August 9. The winners of the democratic and republican primaries face off in the midterm elections on November 8, 2022.

***

Precinct caucus took place on February 1, 2022. There were five people total at my table, including my neighbor, his wife, and his son, plus one more woman thankfully wearing the only mask in the room. Because our precinct was alotted five BPOU delegate slots, each of us was able to nominate ourselves and become delegates without any speeches or voting. A couple of us had brought resolutions we wanted sent up to the next stage for consideration. One close to my heart was a resolution to remove electronic voting equipment.

Of note was I believe an unnecessary governor straw poll, which we were urged to complete by a certain time. One benefit of the straw poll was the opportunity to learn that while about 10,000 republicans voted in it in 2018, more than 17,000 did so in 2022.

Also of note was the attendance of friends who had voted for democrats in the previous election but had come looking for something new. I hope they read this book so they can see I might have observed some of the things they also did.

***

At the BPOU stage, about 34 of the delegates elected at the precinct caucus showed up. There were only 9 slots for delegates moving onto the congressional district convention and the state convention.

I almost *wasn't* a delegate.

Having missed the pre-signup, I only got onto the list to be considered with a few minutes to spare by leaving my seat, going across the room, and asking my BPOU Chair Diana to be included. There was a printed list to which I added my handwritten name. Several others, also apparently unaware of how to get their names on that printed list (printed prior to the meeting), saw me walk over and also did so to get their names written down for consideration. The printed list was 12 people and jumped to about 19. Each of us then gave 30-second speeches as to why we should become delegates.

I said I care about election integrity and plan to support candidates demonstrating courage and a dedication to the truth.

Carleton Crawford, former acting chair and former deputy chair for the MNGOP and current employee of Hennepin County, gave an interesting speech. He said he was going to list himself as an alternate, so no need to vote for him. But please consider voting for those who have put in the time and effort previously into the party. That could be seen as an encouraging nod to his workmates or a clever influence tactic to ensure the regulars got enough votes to move into the next round. Would anyone have cried foul if my speech suggested we needed to have 9 new delegates this year?

I asked to observe the vote counting. Was almost shortchanged one vote but caught it. Ended up getting fourth-most votes after the Chair, her husband (a senate candidate), and the BPOU secretary.

***

A few hours after returning from the CD5 convention, I woke up around 2am. Restless, I soon took to writing my observations from the previous evening, what I've come to refer to as "the CD5 show".



miscount first round (this had happened while i was observing counting in precinct where I would have been shortchanged 1 vote had I not been paying attention and called it out)

miscount would have given Cicely Davis the 60% threshold in the first round. But that was inaccurate, and she didn't quite make it.

so after short speeches, Shukri? concedes and says she will help Cicely

one person in my bpou had left (he was unsure about cicely and may have voted for Royce)

this time, 75% of total for cicely

had royce offended some of the delegates? perhaps

but what he said, i think, would have rung true with the general republican voting population, as well as independents and democrats who are tired of the deteriorating state and country


### State Convention

#### Not Accomodated in Endorsement Process

I announced [my decision to run for secretary of state](https://rumble.com/v13i4tm-mn-secretary-of-state-announcement.html) on May 3, 2022, standing on the back of a pickup truck in the Sherburne County Government Center parking lot, ahead of a County Commissioners Board meeting where Sherburne county residents were making the case to the commissioners to put election integrity on the agenda (short of an agenda item, there is a limited number of speakers and time, three minutes per speaker, in open forum).

Then I emailed several of the MNGOP leadership. Realizing that the convention would start nine days later, I wanted to do everything I could to be included and reduce any extra effort I would cause having entered later than Kim and Kelly.

When I didn't hear back, I contacted my BPOU Chair Diana.

1 email
![1](diane_sos_1.png)

2 email
![2](diane_sos_2.png)

On May 4th, I got a call back from Donna Bergstrom. I said I was thankful for her help and she said, "That's what we're here for."

When I wasn't copied on emails Donna said she would send to get the process rolling, I called her back the next day. She said to Executive Director of the MNGOP, Mike Longergan at mj@mngop.com.

The following emails Mike Lonergan have apparently been deleted on Mike's end, as shown by the [2] instead of the [4] in my Protonmail email client—the emails are no longer viewable in my Protonmail account. (But for once I have Facebook to thank for saving them because I posted them there previously.)

![1](mike_sos_1.png)

![2](mike_sos_2.png)

![3](mike_sos_3.png)

![4](mike_sos_4.png)

![5](mike_sos_5.png)

![6](mike_sos_6.png)

![7](mike_sos_7.png)

![8](mike_sos_8.png)

Of note is the fact that Mike said already on May 5th that I would not be accommodated prior to the proposed rule deadline the following morning on May 6th. Of course, since he did not state this as the reason for non-accommodation, it remains unknown the reason why this decision was made, and by whom. At the end of the day, the MNGOP is a private entity and is legally able to make decisions like these even if they may violate their own MNGOP constitution.

In those early days I received messages and calls from several people, some encouraging and some discouraging. To be expected given the significance of the secretary of state role.

After sharing with a few people an early version of my website which included a segment of this book, it was forwarded (with my permission) to a woman named Donna who said she was volunteering with Kim's campaign. I accepted a phone call. Would I like to meet Kim?, she asked. The suggestion, not confirmed with Kim, was maybe I could be Kim's campaign manager since she was apparently on the lookout for one. Sure, I'll talk with Kim, but can we do it soon? I asked this because I had not yet made my announcement nor informed the MNGOP. A few days passed and there was no meeting or word back, so as I was going to be at the Sherburne rally before the county commmissioners meeting on Tuesday May 3, I decided to make the announcement. The woman who had called me was apparently not happy when she heard the news, but I felt I'd done the best I could to make myself available to Kim's team, if that's what they actually wanted, without further delaying my announcement. Did delaying my announcement give the MNGOP easier reason to not accommodate me? Or would they have declined anyway? We may never know.

Then, a few days prior to the convention, I took a more than one hour phone call with a man named Chris who said he wasn't working for Kim but who seemed to be helping her campaign. It was hard to gauge the purpose of the call except that Chris was curious to know whether I would run. He several times said he enjoyed reading the information on the website. Overall a good conversation with just one red flag going up when he said he didn't think Rick Weible's information was very compelling for non-technical people. Having at that point seen and done video recordings of Rick's work, I had a different opinion. Without Rick's educational presentations and supporting of multiple people and groups across more than a dozen Minnesota counties (and South Dakota), it's hard to say where the grassroots election integrity movements would be right now.

I spoke with Chris at the convention, too, who was able to pull over Kim as well as her husband Marty on Day 2. At the time Kim seemed to be preoccupied with the signage issues (some signs lacked the "paid for by..." language) and indicated it may be better to meet in the coming week. Marty, meanwhile, didn't seem convinced there was machine fraud in Minnesota. Post convention, Rick Weible said Marty called him asking whether Rick could get me to not run for secretary of state. Also, prior to the convention, there was some unfounded speculation that it was Rick's decision for me to run.

It was my decision. If I take guidance from anyone it's [the Boss](https://www.dropbox.com/s/j0ie2tfrnvvdvf7/the_boss.MP4?dl=0).

The day prior, Friday May 12, I watched the secretary of state speeches from the alternates balcony. I'd gone up to meet a friend of a friend. It was a useful vantage point to take in the spectacle. That's what the state convention could be reduced to, in a word. Others called it a circus. A useful metaphor. But the use of spectacle as a *tactic* was also plentifully demonstrated.

![A spectacle to influence endorsement outcomes](convention_balcony.jpg)

Flashing lights, music, speakers on stage with huge video screens behind them. Posters covering every square inch of the walls. T-shirts, "literature", flags. A lot of emotional but often boring speeches. Talk of a red wave with a conspicuous lack of attention—not so much as a mention from the establishment speakers—of the Crime of the Century. Having seen email replies from elected officials and members of the Party during the summer of 2021, I perhaps could have expected them to be silent, but with the increasing queasiness throughout conservative ranks, I thought maybe more would speak up. At least Neil Shah said he thought his vote counted in 2016 but wasn't so sure in 2020.

In their secretary of state candidate speeches, neither [Kim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfdnlYLCZ70) nor [Kelly](https://youtu.be/EMyO6Vfld8k) used the words stolen election or election fraud. There was one mention of ensuring computers not be connected to the internet (in Kim's speech), but that was the only verbal mention of machines. No other comments on electronic voting equipment nor focus put onto the larger and increasingly centralized modern electronic voting system.

That was a bit depressing but it emphasized to me that there was work right in front of me to do, which I was thankful for.

Kim didn't get the endorsement in the first round, ending up a few percentage points shy of the required 60%. We went onto round 2: the delegates voted again. I voted no endorsement twice (I wasn't the only one to do so) because I couldn't vote for a candidate that hadn't acknowledged the stolen election nor emphasized the necessity to minimize voter fraud going forward, including by supporting the removal of the uncertified cheat machines.

After the roughly ten minute delay from the votes going through the Padgett electronic devices into the software tallying computers (to be reviewed by the Party) and finally up onto the big screen, I was surprised *not* to see the results be displayed; instead, Kelly came out, thanked her volunteers, and conceded. Since I voted, and so did over 2,000 delegates, I wanted to know the result of the election. That seemed like the right thing to do, too.

God helped me catch up with both Kelly and Kim right after Kelly's concession speech.

[The conversation with Kelly](https://www.dropbox.com/s/yu0jtnd81avf2uf/kelly_sos_endorsement.m4a?dl=0) left me with questions.

From the conversation:

ERIK: "Did you by chance see the second round results?"

KELLY: "I, um, no, because we knew they were good. But I'm not going to worry about the results right now. Right now I'm just going to chill with my family."

I don't know who the "we" is that Kelly is refering to. I assume "they" refers to the results. But wasn't Kelly eager to verify that her opponent actually won? And if she wasn't shown the vote totals, could she have been lied to about them?

Right after that, I crossed paths with Kim. She too could not confirm the results of the second round of voting. But a woman next to her, sensing my dismay, said she must have won by a lot. They escaped my further questions through a door.

Now, I wasn't sure what to make of this. There were several possibilities, including but not limited to:

1. Kim had reached 60%—as a result, Kelly decides to concede, either requesting or accepting an offer to make a concession speech in exchange for not having the results shared on the big screen for the delegates
2. Kim had again not eclipsed 60%—a deal is struck where Kelly concedes even though the rules state a third round of voting must occur if no candidate reaches 60%
3. Kelly (or Kelly *and* Kim) were told Kim had won—Kelly decides to concede without verifying whether Kim had indeed reached 60% or not

Any of these three may have occurred, the third being slightly more likely in my opinion based on the fact that Kelly says she did not see the second round results: "I, um, no, because we knew they were good."

I later asked Rep. Eric Lucero what he thought. He said that was normal, not indicating he took issue with it.

Now, it may be how things have been done in the past, but that doesn't make it right. Chair David Haan had stood before the more than two thousand attendees talking about how great the electronic voting equipment was. And not only would they not share the source code nor demonstrate its auditability, but in this case they weren't even going to put the results on the big screen. Someone else suggested to me this was a common face-saving practice. That was not satisfying to me.

When not many people seemed share my concern about the lack of transparency, my attention to detail was further heightened.

I think the overall endorsement process in Minnesota is rife with irregularities which water down the value of endorsements in general, but each endorsement should be evaluated on a case by case basis. For example, candidates like Mark Bishofsky worked really hard to get delegates favorable to him into the process in order to comfortably win his District 33B endorsement. I haven't even begun to discuss the unopposed state auditor endorsement, the attorney general endorsement, or the governor endorsement. I have thoughts but I think careful readers will have gotten a feel for what I am paying attention to and a hint at my provisional conclusions.

In the case of secretary of state, I'm not sure what to think. And what may have happened if a third candidate who couldn't be "accommodated" had been given the chance to speak?

Candidates without an endorsement tag may do just fine this year. Natural turnout will be high for a midterm, possibly historic, with independents and democrats voting for republicans in great numbers. Candidates without endorsements, such as Doug Wardlow, will do well in large part because voters are paying much closer attention to detail, having been woken up by the narrative collapses of Covid-19 and the Big Lie.

Compared with just a year ago, more people are able to read and research open source intelligence (OSINT) and seek the truth with a discerning eye and spirit, not giving up until they find it. They are looking at old questions with fresh eyes and having the wisdom and courage to expect and demand candidates for public office be ready to serve their constituents and not other masters.

## Electronic Voting

We used [electronic voting devices](https://erikvanmechelen.substack.com/p/electronic-voting-devices-used-at) at the convention through a proposed rule change that was voted on using a standing vote, passing by about 85%/15%. When we lost, I smiled and nodded to a woman seated across the aisle. So this is the crowd we're in?

![Chair of the MNGOP, David Haan](saboteur.png)

This after the Chair of the Party in an email days before the convention suggested anyone even asking questions about the electronic devices from the German company, Padgett, were "saboteurs." Prior to the endorsement process, a motion to strike the proposed rule (to use electronic voting devices) was debated. Several speakers spoke for and against the proposed rule prior to a standing vote. Susan Shogren Smith read the Minnesota Constitution regarding [the required use of ballots for elections](https://youtu.be/X7dYzfby-Fo), which includes these endorsement elections.

Later, during the endorsement voting rounds, there were no announcements that I recall addressing the reports of the [electronic voting device glitches](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/uHEjYRGK01s). Sometimes the vote would not send. The device would ask the voter to vote a SECOND time. Does this mean the original vote did not go through? What would have happened if the voter pressed send, put the device in their pocket, and then didn’t realize the glitch? Would their original vote have counted? Or would there be a no-vote or empty vote which the software could designate for another candidate? This last sentence is speculation, but since the source code was not shown to delegates nor were audits of results shared showing individual device IDs and vote numbers, we cannot yet verify whether our votes went through as we desired. It would have been trivial to program a no vote on some percentage of inputs of a given number, just for one example.

Not sure if you can tell, but I'm not a fan of electronic voting equipment. That said, how could these electronic voting device results be verified?

It would have been simple to share a report showing my device number, 413, with my vote, 7, on the screen to verify to me that my vote went through (and keeping my vote secret).

Even if using the big screen to scroll through the more than 2,000 device IDs and votes took a few minutes, that would be completed well before the 10 minutes negotiation period for candidates to make deals back stage or in their war rooms.

Campaigns should demand audits of every round of every candidate race: secretary of state, attorney general, and governor (there was only 1 candidate for state auditor, so no voting required there). Dr. Neil Shah asked, but received no response.

But the MNGOP should have provided these reports to every delegate in real time.

At a minimum, this would have quieted down skeptics like me whose distrust grew as I personally experienced and witnessed glitches, heard about at least one device left unattended, and watched for instance Mike Murphy lose about 60 votes between rounds 3 and 4 after taking the lead in round 3. Were people really swapping their votes *away* from the leading candidate after he'd just taken the lead? Even a prominent house rep speculated about vote shaving.

## Primary Election on August 9

I was embarrassed that I previously mindlessly just voted for the republican candidates and was not involved in helping to choose them. Having seen how the party puts forward candidates, I am further embarrassed. Because I was duped. I was under a spell.

We have endorsed candidates and unendorsed candidates, establishment and grassroots America First.

The stage is set.

With the context of heightened concern around voting processes and the modern electronic voting system which in Minnesota seems to violate Minnesota Statute 206.57 Subd.6 Required Certification on account of there being no testing lab identified by the EAC to conduct VVSG 2.0 certifications, we are heading into interesting territory.

But what matters more is not who wins, but whether the truth wins.

Will the electronic voting systems which tabulate, record, and report our vote totals be trusted? I don't think they can stand up to the pressure. But that will depend in part on you.
