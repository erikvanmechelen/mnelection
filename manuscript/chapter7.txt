# Chapter Five - Minnesota in 2022

*"These people don't understand."*

—Isabelle, shortly after having the mic taken away from her as a delegate at the MNGOP state convention while speaking about electronic voting machines, whose mom and dad lost everything in Communist Ecuador


*"Did you by chance see the second round results?"*

*"I, um, no, because we knew they were good. But I'm not going to worry about the results right now. Right now I'm just going to chill with my family."*

—Part of [a conversation between the author and Kelly Jahner-Byrne](https://www.dropbox.com/s/yu0jtnd81avf2uf/kelly_sos_endorsement.m4a?dl=0) soon after her concession speech

In the psychological realm, in mid-to-late 2020, George Floyd dominated news cycles. Covid-19 was also a daily discussion topic on and offline. This provided distraction, air cover, and justification for procedural changes which flew in the face of existing Minnesota law and took our focus off the voting machines.

Just as there were distractions in 2020, in the runup to the 2022 midterm elections, there has been no shortage of diversions attempted by those who wish to keep us from reclaiming our government.

This Rasmussen survey shows what voters care about versus what the media cares about:

![61% Very Concerned About Election Integrity](ras_survey.png)

Back in February, the beginning of the election process started in Minnesota at the precinct caucuses.

There, the key item of business is electing delegates. Those chosen in their precincts will then serve as delegates at the basic political organizing unit (BPOU) level. From there, another round of voting happens to elect delegates to the congressional district and state conventions, where endorsements occur for governor, attorney general, state auditor, and secretary of state.

In a world where most republican voters understood how to get involved starting in the precinct caucuses, this system has a chance to reliably produce solid candidates. That hasn't happened in the past. I too was a first timer and gradually learned how in practice the delegate selection process and ultimatly endorsements are a carefully crafted and heavily influenced outcome.

The Party says it wants to support endorsed candidates and discourages coverage of non-endorsed candidates. Meanwhile, the MNGOP has shown in reality it doesn't fully respect its own endorsements. For example, [Mark Bishofksy](https://markformnhouse.com/), endorsed candidate for 33B who single-handedly kickstarted the [Stop the Mandate](https://stopthemandatemn.org/) movement and hosted medical freedom rallies with thousands at the Capitol, is facing a challenger arguably more liked by the MNGOP leadership. Why is the MNGOP supporting this candidate in a race against the already endorsed candidate?

What I've observed is that the MNGOP, a private entity, works very hard to control who eventually becomes an endorsed candidate, even pulling stunts to avoid the endorsement of candidates like Nathan Wesenberg in SD10 that are a threat to their current grip on power. It's only a matter of time before the majority of people see what they've been up to and reclaim what has been taken from them.

## The Preparation Phase in Minnesota for 2022

The preparation phase as described by Patrick Colbeck is in full swing around the country and in Minnesota.

It boils down to:
1. maneuvering desired candidates onto the ballot and using influence operations to promote them
2. keeping in place election laws and rules which tend to weaken election fairness and transparency
3. most important – keeping the machines

It matters a lot which candidates are on the ballot for a primary or general election. Imagine if Jeb Bush or Ted Cruz had faced off against Hillary Clinton in 2016, instead of Donald Trump. In that dystopia, some percentage of republican voters may have stayed home and Hillary may have won easily. Unexciting candidates lead to low legitimate turnout. But if voters stay home a vote can be cast in their stead through real-time monitoring in the manner already described in the Attack Phase.

The method of putting forward unexciting candidates is also effective in state and local elections. As the media and the Republican establishment tries to get us talking about a red wave, we must stay vigilant and put forward America First candidates. A red wave of establishment candidates could spell the end of our country.

To avoid that disaster requires that America First candidates stand up and join races, from school board to county commissioner to senate. It does no one any good to elect candidates who can be influenced away from the principles of upholding the constitution when the enemy is no longer at the gates but is fully occupying our territory.

Election laws in Minnesota continue to allow drop boxes, even though some areas have passed resolutions to remove them. Absentee voting and early voting are still legal for everyone, not only for distant military or the legitimately sick.

Electronic voting machines, from epollbooks to tabulators to election management systems, are still very much in play and it's conceivable that the cast vote records (CVR) reports will again *not* be turned ON, leaving Minnesotans without a trustworthy machine audit trail. If machines count the votes and they aren't fully auditable, election results can't be trusted.

## The Delegate Selection Process

Right from the jump, there were issues at the precinct caucuses. [Numerous reports of tampering](https://saveminnesota.org/evidence) in [Otter Tail County], Morrison County, and Clay County (but not only there) suggested delegate lists were being changed either at the BPOU level or the state level (or both). Unless an audit was done, reconciling the eyewitness and documented accounts would be difficult. No audits were done.

In Clay County, attempts were made by party operatives [to remove the BPOU chair Edwin Hahn](https://youtu.be/dMfCeMuLuZc?t=522)—in a locked room in the library led by Michelle Fischbach staffer Calvin Benson. The Chair of the Clay County BPOU sent [this cease and desist letter](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s4ANas8A8tOai0Qiw-dXMpzCKjHcv4km/view) to David Haan on March 30, 2022.

![Cease and Desist Letter sent to MNGOP Chair David Haan](edwin_hahn.png)

The Party has not quit its antics to hold onto power while more and more regular people are dismayed by the lengths they will go to do so.

In Polk County, the BPOU Chair was recently [sent this letter](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lb2k888hp69k5s8/1655998272163_06-15-2022%20SD%201%20Cease%20and%20Desist%20Letter%20FINAL.pdf?dl=0) by the Party after he set up [a training course](https://facl-training.org/schools/events/east-grand-forks-mn-pls-16jul2022) to be held on July 16. In doing so, the Party claims Jon Ross and others are "involved in efforts to organize against endorsed Republican candidates."

![MNGOP scrambles to hold onto power](cease_and_desist_polk.png)

These aren't the only tactics Party operatives have used.

In Kittson County, Amanda and Dave Hughes came under attack after [Dave Hughes](https://ballotpedia.org/Dave_Hughes) decided to challenge for the Minnesota State Senate in District 1 versus the establishment's Mark Johnson.

According to Amanda, the Executive Director of the Campaign Finance Board (CFB) was contacted in early June by Ron Huettl, Finance Director of the Republican Party of Minnesota, with a “serious concern” over the fact that the Kittson Rebuplicans are not filing with the CFB. Ron never called Amanda or Dave. So what were Ron's intentions?

![Chair Haan's weak and illegitimate attempt to dissolve the Kittson BPOU](amanda_kittson_1.jpg)

On June 23, 2022, the Kittson Republicans Treasurer Jacob Bakke received this confirmation from the Executive Director of the CFB, showing there were no issues from the perspective of the CFB. The Executive Director confirms the Kittson Republicans need not register if they have incomes less than $750 per year. And there is no investigation.

![Confirmation from the CFB that there is no investigation and all is well](amanda_kittson_2.jpg)

Chair Hann doesn’t have the authority to dissolve a BPOU. Only the Kittson Republicans can.

The Kittson Republicans exist because they organized, wrote and passed a Constitution and elected officers. Their status isn’t based on our registration with the CFB.

The group is small. There were only about 1,500 republican voters in the 2020 general election.

Amanda said: "Destroying party structure shouldn’t be the agenda of the Chair." I agree 100% with her.

"Of course it's not about that," said Amanda. "We have two Republicans running in SD1. No other candidates. The Primary winner sails through the general without spending a penny. So this is because my husband is challenging Mark Johnson."

Forgive them for they know not what they do; the context—their diminishing power—demands these actions of them. They think they will get away with this. But now *you* know the truth, so they have not.

If you are part of or connected to the Republican Party, it is important to hold your own leadership to account. Ask them why they are trying to disrupt Clay County, Kittson County, and Polk County. These are not the only places stories have emerged, loud and clear. This call to action includes BPOU chairs and your average conservative, republican voter. (This book will be emailed to every BPOU chair in Minnesota.)

## Confirmed and Documented Tampering of Delegate Lists

Returning to delegate lists.

Seeing how the [confirmed reports of delegate tampering](https://www.action4liberty.com/corruption_in_morrison_county_gop) were (or weren't) handled, I couldn't help wondering how many more delegate list incidents went unnoticed and therefore unreported. I emailed my BPOU Chair about this to see whether our lists could be confirmed.

![Feb 16 email to my BPOU Chair](diane_feb16_1.png)

Diane responded suggesting this happened because of previous delegates somehow  including previous delegate attendees.

![The bulk of the problem](diane_caucus_feb16_2.png)

When she suggests "that was the bulk of the problem" it indicates to me that she was aware of the larger issue (or various kinds of issues) bubbling up in other areas. And why would other BPOUs have included previous caucus attendees on their lists? Only delegates elected at the precinct caucuses become delegates or alternates. Having previously been on a delegate list does not qualify someone to be a delegate in the future.

I responded the next day.

![A request for more transparency](diane_caucus.png)

Her response doesn't answer all of my questions and suggests she was taking direction from the state party.

![Feb 17 reply from my BPOU Chair](diane_caucus3.png)

I sent one more email which did not recieve a reply.

![Feb 18 to BPOU Chair](diane_feb18.png)

I am thankful that Diane engaged in this email thread, because I haven't always, as we shall see, been able to get email replies from everyone in MNGOP, in particular the leadership.

What I'd already learned about [what took place in Morrison County](https://soundcloud.com/user-191695017/caucus-conventions-and-corruption-in-the-mngop-with-nathan-wesenberg-part-1-of-2) combined with this exchange had me wondering: How many delegates at BPOU conventions, endorsing conventions, and finally the state convention would ultimately be illegitimate?

For just one example that soon emerged, consider the [delegate lists from Otter Tail County](https://saveminnesota.org/otter-tail/f/otter-tail-report-election-tampering-in-10-precincts).

![Otter Tail Delegate List Discrepancies](otter_tail_delegates.png)

From [this detailed report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Mq8vRXwOQTw9ZsQQCm3MRIYwrD_khx10/view) it was discovered that "two individuals whose eligibility is in question, were elected at the March 19th County Convention to represent the county at the State and Congressional District Conventions – one as a delegate, the other as an alternate." The opening sentence of the conclusion of this report reads: "If caucus precinct delegations have been systemically altered, it would appear to undermine the foundational integrity of our democratic process."

Having reviewed some of [these reports](https://saveminnesota.org/evidence) and having spoken with dozens of people about delegate lists from across the state, including people like Nathan Wesenberg [in this conversation](https://soundcloud.com/user-191695017/caucus-conventions-and-corruption-in-the-mngop-with-nathan-wesenberg-part-1-of-2), my gut feeling says that perhaps as much as 12-15% of state convention delegates in Rochester may not have been legitimate. Remember, this could be more *or* less, but since BPOUs and the Party were not able to demonstrate reconciliation of the lists, we may never know.

The lack of a tight yet transparent chain of custody of the data is as much an issue with these lists as it is with our votes cast at conventions or in primary or general elections.

![Counties Affected So Far - saveminnesota.org](save_minnesota_counties.png)

Even if we conservatively speculated that only about 1 state delegate per county (87 counties) should not have been included (replacing someone else), then that would represent a large voting bloc shift. If only about 100 people were replaced, that is a potential swing of a net 200 votes, about a 10% swing as there were about 2,200 seated casting votes for the endorsing segments in Rochester. Of course, no one is duty bound to vote for one candidate or another in advance, but if it is true that delegates were being replaced—and that has been shown to be the case—why was that being done?

From one point of view, the result is equivalent to inflating voter rolls (in the statewide voter registration system). From another vantage point, the result is equivalent to a [vote swap in an election management system](https://rumble.com/vgi89t-hacking-democracy-antrim-county-mi-edition.html).

*Note: Even though I am a candidate for secretary of state, I never received delegate lists from the MNGOP as other candidates were provided—in case as a delegate you were wondering why you may not get emails from me. Therefore I am reaching the people of Minnesota through this book.*

## Endorsing Conventions

Endorsing conventions allow the MNGOP to select an "endorsed" candidate, who will get to carry that badge forward. These conventions happen at the senate district, congressional district, and state level.

How do you get to participate and vote in these conventions?

By becoming a delegate.

Starting at the precinct level, then the BPOU level (Basic Political Organizing Unit), then the congressional district and finally the state convention.

At each stage you may nominate yourself and then your peers must elect you to move forward.

Eventually, a bit over 2,000 delegates make their way to the state convention to select the endorsed candidates for state auditor, secretary of state, attorney general, and governor. These 2,000 delegates have tremendous influence because they are determining the endorsed candidate on behalf of about 1.5 million republican voters in Minnesota.

Candidates without the endorsement can still run as republicans in the primary elections, this year happening on August 9. The winners of the democratic and republican primaries face off in the midterm elections on November 8, 2022.

***

Precinct caucus took place on February 1, 2022. There were five people total at my table, including my neighbor, his wife, and his son, plus one more woman thankfully wearing the only mask in the room. Because our precinct was alotted five BPOU delegate slots, each of us was able to nominate ourselves and become delegates without any speeches or voting. A couple of us had brought resolutions we wanted sent up to the next stage for consideration. One close to my heart was a resolution to remove electronic voting equipment. (Please note, this is quite different from a resolution drafted by a county commission to remove electronic voting equipment, which if passed in a county commissioner board meeting has real weight.)

Of note was (I believe) an unnecessary governor straw poll, which we were urged to complete by a certain time. One benefit of the straw poll was the opportunity to learn that while about 10,000 republicans voted in it in 2018, more than 17,000 did so in 2022.

Also of note was the attendance of friends who had voted for democrats in the previous election but had come looking for something new. I hope they read or listen to this book so they can see I might have observed some of the things they also did.

***

At the BPOU stage in my district, about 34 of the delegates elected at the precinct caucus showed up. There were only 9 slots for delegates moving onto the congressional district convention and the state convention.

I almost *didn't* become a delegate.

Having missed the pre-signup (by email?), I only got onto the list to be considered with a few minutes to spare by leaving my seat, going across the room, and asking my BPOU Chair Diane to be included. There was a printed list to which I added my handwritten name. Several others, also apparently unaware of how to get their names on that printed list (printed prior to the meeting), saw me walk over and also did so to get their names written down for consideration. The printed list was 12 people and jumped to about 19. Since we were vying for one of 9 slots, each of us then gave 30-second speeches as to why we should become delegates.

I said I care about election integrity and plan to support candidates demonstrating courage and a dedication to the truth.

Carleton Crawford, former acting chair and former deputy chair for the MNGOP and current employee of Hennepin County, gave an interesting speech. He said he was going to list himself as an alternate, so no need to vote for him. But please consider voting for those who have put in the time and effort previously into the Party.

Why did I find that interesting? His words could be seen as an encouraging nod to his workmates but also as a clever influence tactic to ensure the regulars got enough votes to move into the next round. Would anyone have cried foul if my speech suggested we needed to have 9 new delegates this year?

I asked to observe the vote counting.

Notably, I was almost shortchanged one vote but pointed it out—it was quickly amended. My simplye speech garnered me the fourth-most votes after the Chair, her husband (a senate candidate), and the BPOU secretary.

***

Near the basement entrance to VFW Post 494 in Crystal, MN, I was soon asked whether I would like to wear a sticker by a man working with one of the campaigns. When I declined he said, "I understand not wanting to be a walking poster." Nodding, I pulled back my jacket to reveal my t-shirt and said, "But I already am."

The t-shirt read:

Minnesota, No. 1 in Voter ~~Turnout~~ Fraud

Instead of a walking poster for any one candidate, I would go on to advocate for the issue I was surprised to learn that few wanted to discuss that day.

At this, the CD5 Convention of the Minnesota Republican Party, nearly 17 months after the November 3rd, 2020 General Election, very few if any speakers acknowledged that the election was rigged and none mentioned electronic voting equipment (epollbooks, tabulators, election management systems). Stating the obvious would surely have scored them political points (or so I thought) so why was almost everyone shying away? Only by plainly stating the problem is there any chance of going about fixing it. What's more, at that late hour, we were already at a moment where surface level issues of the election coup were obvious—because elections have consequences we are witnessing the decades long result of leaders being (s)elected, not elected.

It is easy to complain and feel good about knowing some fact that your neighbor may not yet know. But now the focus should be on solutions and taking action toward them. In the realm of elections, there are simple remedies to the overly complex and easily exploitable system currently in place.

A few hours after returning from the CD5 convention, I woke up around 2am. Restless, I soon took to writing my observations from the previous evening, what I've come to refer to as ["the CD5 show"](https://erikvanmechelen.substack.com/p/the-cd5-show).

Besides the lack of substantive noises about election integrity, the big event was Cicely Davis and Royce White and Shukri Abdirahman competing for the CD5 endorsement.

There was a miscount in the first round of voting. The miscount would have given Cicely Davis the 60% threshold in the first round. But that was inaccurate, and she didn't quite make it.

Then Shukri gave a short speech saying she was dropping out to help Cicely. One person in my BPOU had left (he was unsure about Cicely and may have voted for Royce) and others may have too. This time, in round 2, 75% voted for Cicely, including myself.

I immediately sensed it was the wrong decision which did not put me in a good mood.

Was it true as was reported that Royce had offended some of the delegates? Perhaps. But what he said, I think, would have rung true with the general republican voting population (numbering about 1.5 million and probably more by now), as well as independents and democrats who are tired of the deteriorating state and country currently under occupation.

## The Secretary of State Endorsement

I announced [my decision to run for secretary of state](https://rumble.com/v13i4tm-mn-secretary-of-state-announcement.html) on May 3, 2022, standing on the back of a pickup truck in the Sherburne County Government Center parking lot, ahead of a County Commissioners Board meeting where Sherburne county residents were making the case to the commissioners to put election integrity on the agenda (short of an agenda item, there is a limited number of speakers and time, three minutes per speaker, in open forum).

Then I emailed several of the MNGOP leadership. Realizing that the convention would start nine days later, I wanted to do everything I could to be included and reduce any extra effort I would cause having entered later than Kim and Kelly.

![Trying to reach the MNGOP leadership](mike_sos_6.png)

When I still didn't hear back, I contacted my BPOU Chair Diane.

![May 4 email to Diane, asking my BPOU Chair for help](diane_sos_1.png)

![May 4 reply from Diane](diane_sos_2.png)

On May 4th, I got a call back from Donna Bergstrom. I said I was thankful for her help and she said, "That's what we're here for."

When I wasn't copied on emails Donna said she would send to get the process rolling, I called her back the next day. We did not have another phone call but she did say to email Executive Director of the MNGOP, Mike Longergan at mj@mngop.com (which readers will note I already did above).

![2nd Email to Mike, this time after Donna Bergstrom phone call](mike_sos_1.png)

![Reply from Mike same day](mike_sos_2.png)

![Reply to Mike's email the same evening](mike_sos_3.png)

![After no phone call, trying to be included](mike_sos_7.png)

![Another request to be included in Nominations Committee](mike_sos_4.png)

![We will be unable to accommodate you](mike_sos_5.png)

![Facebook post on May 12 to supporters](mike_sos_8.png)

Of note is the fact that Mike said already on May 5th that I would not be accommodated prior to the proposed rule deadline the following morning on May 6th. Of course, since he did not state this as the reason for non-accommodation, it remains unknown the reason why this decision was made, and by whom. At the end of the day, the MNGOP is a private entity and is legally able to make decisions like these even if they may violate their own MNGOP constitution or convention rules.

I may not have published these emails in this book if not for the growing trend of MNGOP members trying to stop discussion on election integrity like this [presentation in Rochester on election machines](https://rumble.com/v18c88v-machines-in-minnesota-june-12-2022.html) or this discussion about [the county commissioner strategy with Mark Bishofsky](https://rumble.com/v18p9ol-30-minutes-with-mark-bishofsky-about-election-improvements-in-minnesota.html).

This continuing behavior from Party members only gives me cause to wonder if the MNGOP leadership didn't want me as part of the endorsement process in order to prevent me from speaking and introducing myself to the 2,000+ delegates in Rochester. One might further wonder whether they were afraid of someone mentioning the Crime of the Century which they seem to have been completely fine with given their near silence on the issue.

In those early days following the secretary of state announcement I received messages and calls from several people, some seemingly trying to discourage me from the decision I'd already made. That was to be expected given the significance of the secretary of state role. Note for instance the congruity of actions amongst a number of secretaries of state around the country; they repeat ad nauseam how secure the election in their state was while refusing to perform actual audits and demeaning anyone asking honest questions about the process, machines, or results.

My own BPOU Chair asked why I'd chosen secretary of state instead of house rep. She thought I would face stiff competition but wished me luck. On May 31st, the final day of the filing deadline, and 12 days after I'd officially filed for secretary of state on May 18th, someone from the Party called to ask whether I'd like to run for house instead.

After sharing with a few people an early version of my website which included a segment of this book, it was forwarded (with my permission) to a woman named Donna who said she was volunteering with Kim's campaign. I accepted a phone call. Would I like to meet Kim?, she asked. The suggestion, not confirmed with Kim, was maybe I could be Kim's campaign manager since she was apparently on the lookout for one. Sure, I'll talk with Kim, but can we do it soon? I asked this because I had not yet made my announcement nor informed the MNGOP. A few days passed and there was no meeting or word back, so as I was going to be at the Sherburne rally before the county commmissioners meeting on Tuesday May 3, I decided to [make the announcement](https://rumble.com/v13i4tm-mn-secretary-of-state-announcement.html).

The woman who had called me was apparently not happy when she heard the news, but I felt I'd done the best I could to make myself available to Kim's team, if that's what they actually wanted, without further delaying my announcement. Did delaying my announcement give the MNGOP easier reason to not accommodate me? Or would they have declined anyway? We may never know.

Then, a few days prior to the convention, I took a more than one hour phone call with a man named Chris who said he wasn't working for Kim but who seemed to be helping her campaign. It was hard to gauge the purpose of the call except that Chris was curious to learn more of my thoughts on elections and to know whether I would run. He several times said he enjoyed reading the information on the website. Overall a good conversation with just one red flag going up when he said he didn't think Rick Weible's information was very compelling for non-technical people. Having at that point seen and done video recordings of Rick's work, I had a different opinion. Without Rick's educational presentations and supporting of multiple people and groups across more than a dozen Minnesota counties (and South Dakota), it's hard to say where the grassroots election integrity movements would be right now.

I spoke with Chris at the convention, too, who was able to pull over Kim as well as her husband Marty on Day 2. At the time Kim seemed to be preoccupied with the signage issues (some signs lacked the "paid for by..." language) and indicated it may be better to meet in the coming week. Marty, meanwhile, didn't seem convinced there was machine fraud in Minnesota after apparently speaking on these issues often in prior years. That was too bad because we were all there and could easily have discussed whatever Chris hoped we could discuss.

Post convention, Rick Weible said Marty called him asking whether Rick could get me to *not* run for secretary of state. Was this part of the purpose of the huddle at the convention?

Also, prior to the convention, there was some unfounded speculation that it was Rick's decision for me to run.

Let me clear that up.

It was my decision.

I follow no one but Jesus.

If I take guidance from anyone it's [the Boss](https://www.dropbox.com/s/j0ie2tfrnvvdvf7/the_boss.MP4?dl=0).

The day before the huddle with Kim, Marty, and Chris, on Friday May 12, I watched the secretary of state speeches from the alternates balcony. I'd gone up to meet a friend of a friend. I felt bad for the alternates who had to sit up here and not be included, but it was a useful vantage point to take in the spectacle. That's what the state convention could be reduced to, in a word. Others called it a circus. A useful metaphor. But the use of spectacle as a *tactic* was also plentifully demonstrated.

![A spectacle to influence endorsement outcomes](convention_balcony.jpg)

Flashing lights, music, speakers on stage with huge video screens behind them. Posters covering every square inch of the walls. T-shirts, "literature", flags. A lot of emotional but often boring speeches lacking content. Talk of a red wave with a conspicuous lack of attention—not so much as a mention from the establishment speakers—of the Crime of the Century. Having seen email replies from elected officials and members of the Party during the summer of 2021—many of which if published would make them look very weak—I perhaps could have expected them to be silent, but with the increasing queasiness throughout conservative ranks that something deeper was wrong than just losing an election to run-of-the-mill democrats, I thought maybe more would speak up. At least Neil Shah said he thought his vote counted in 2016 but wasn't so sure it did in 2020.

In their secretary of state candidate speeches, neither [Kim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfdnlYLCZ70) nor [Kelly](https://youtu.be/EMyO6Vfld8k) used the words stolen election or election fraud. There was one mention of ensuring computers not be connected to the internet (in Kim's speech), but that was the only verbal mention of machines. No other comments on electronic voting equipment nor focus put onto the larger and increasingly centralized modern electronic voting system, nor a description of how its lack of certification under the VVSG 2.0 guidelines may violate Minnesota's election code.

That was a bit depressing but it emphasized to me that there was work right in front of me to do, which I was thankful for.

Kim didn't get the endorsement in the first round, ending up a few percentage points shy of the required 60%. We went onto round 2: the delegates voted again. I voted no endorsement twice (I wasn't the only one to do so) because I couldn't vote for a candidate that hadn't acknowledged the stolen election nor emphasized the necessity to minimize voter fraud going forward, including by supporting the removal of the uncertified cheat machines.

After the roughly ten minute delay from the votes going through the Padgett electronic devices into the software tallying computers (to be reviewed by the Party) and finally up onto the big screen, I was surprised *not* to see the results be displayed; instead, Kelly came out, thanked her volunteers, and conceded. Since I voted, and so did over 2,000 delegates, I wanted to know the result of the election. That seemed like the right thing to do, too.

God helped me catch up with both Kelly and Kim right after Kelly's concession speech.

[The conversation with Kelly](https://www.dropbox.com/s/yu0jtnd81avf2uf/kelly_sos_endorsement.m4a?dl=0) left me with questions.

From the conversation:

ERIK: "Did you by chance see the second round results?"

KELLY: "I, um, no, because we knew they were good. But I'm not going to worry about the results right now. Right now I'm just going to chill with my family."

I don't know who the "we" is that Kelly is refering to. I assume "they" refers to the results. But wasn't Kelly eager to verify that her opponent actually won? And if she wasn't shown the vote totals, could she have been lied to about them?

Right after that, I crossed paths with Kim. She too could not confirm the results of the second round of voting nor whether she had even seen them. But a woman next to her, sensing my dismay, said she must have won by a lot. They escaped my further questions through a door.

Now, I wasn't sure what to make of this. There were several possibilities, including but not limited to:

1. Kim had reached 60%—as a result, Kelly decides to concede, either requesting or accepting an offer to make a concession speech in exchange for not having the results shared on the big screen for the delegates
2. Kim had again not eclipsed 60%—a deal is struck where Kelly concedes even though the rules state a third round of voting must occur if no candidate reaches 60%
3. Kelly (or Kelly *and* Kim) were told Kim had won—Kelly decides to concede without verifying whether Kim had indeed reached 60% or not

Any of these three may have occurred, the third being slightly more likely in my opinion based on the fact that Kelly says she did not see the second round results: "I, um, no, because we knew they were good."

Maybe with further conversation with Kim and Kelly or the MNGOP it can be cleared up what exactly happened, for those of us delegates (and anyone else) that are interested.

I later asked Rep. Eric Lucero what he thought about the MNGOP not showing the results on the big screen. He said that was normal and did not indicate he took issue with it.

Now, it may be how things have been done in the past, but that doesn't make it right. Chair David Haan had stood before the more than two thousand attendees talking about how great the electronic voting equipment was. And not only would they not share the source code nor demonstrate its auditability, but in this case they weren't even going to put the results on the big screen. Someone else suggested to me this was a common face-saving practice for the losing candidate. That was not satisfying to me.

When not many people seemed share my concern about the lack of transparency, my attention to detail was further heightened.

## How Much is a Party Endorsement Worth?

I think the overall endorsement process in Minnesota is rife with irregularities which water down the value of endorsements in general, but each endorsement should be evaluated on a case by case basis. For example, candidates like Mark Bishofsky worked really hard to get delegates favorable to him into the process in order to comfortably win his District 33B endorsement. Nathan Wesenberg also educated his base who showed up in strong numbers—although he was stimied with a different tactic to prevent an endorsement from even happening.

Now, I haven't even begun to discuss the unopposed state auditor endorsement, the attorney general endorsement, or the governor endorsement. I have thoughts but I think careful readers will have gotten a feel for what I am paying attention to and a hint at my provisional conclusions.

In the case of secretary of state, I'm not sure what to think. And what may have happened if a third candidate who couldn't be "accommodated" had been given the chance to speak?

Candidates without an endorsement tag may do just fine this year. Natural turnout will be high for a midterm, possibly historic, with independents and democrats voting for republicans in great numbers. Candidates without endorsements, such as Doug Wardlow, will do well in large part because voters are paying much closer attention to detail, having been woken up by the narrative collapses of Covid-19 and the real Big Lie, that somehow the Big Guy surpassed 81 million votes.

Compared with just a year ago, more people are able to read and research open source intelligence (OSINT) and seek the truth with a discerning eye and spirit, not giving up until they find it. They are looking at old questions with fresh eyes and having the wisdom and courage to expect and demand candidates for public office be ready to serve their constituents and not other masters.

On the broader subject of endorsements, my hope is for readers to take not the Party's or another person's word for a candidate's merits, but instead take it upon themselves to ask basic questions about a candidate for public office. Ask and keep asking and you shall receive.

A few questions you might ask: Does the candidate acknowledge the stolen election? Are they truly America First? Do they listen to you when you speak? Do you think they will listen to you once in office? Are they demonstrating real work (not fake credentials) to prove to you they know what they are talking about, are capable of doing the job, and also are taking risks to represent the people in the face of tyranny?

## Electronic Voting

[David Haan's plea](https://www.facebook.com/100078310876790/videos/690779968839417/) led to the use of [electronic voting devices](https://erikvanmechelen.substack.com/p/electronic-voting-devices-used-at) at the convention through a proposed rule change that was voted on using a standing vote, passing by about 85%/15%. Once again, in my opinion, convenience was chosen over accuracy and reliability. When the decision was made, I smiled and nodded to a woman seated across the aisle. So this is the crowd we're in?

This after the Chair of the Party in an email days before the convention suggested anyone even asking questions about the electronic devices from the German company, Padgett, were "saboteurs." Prior to the endorsement process, a motion to strike the proposed rule (to use electronic voting devices) was debated. Several speakers spoke for and against the proposed rule prior to a standing vote. Susan Shogren Smith read the Minnesota Constitution regarding [the required use of ballots for elections](https://youtu.be/X7dYzfby-Fo), which includes these endorsement elections.

Later, during the endorsement voting rounds, there were no announcements that I recall addressing the reports of the [electronic voting device glitches](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/uHEjYRGK01s). Sometimes the vote would not send. The device would ask the voter to vote a SECOND time. Does this mean the original vote did not go through? What would have happened if the voter pressed send, put the device in their pocket, and then didn’t realize the glitch? Would their original vote have counted? Or would there be a no-vote or empty vote which the software could designate for another candidate? This last sentence is speculation, but since the source code was not shown to delegates nor were audits of results shared showing individual device IDs and vote numbers, we cannot yet verify whether our votes went through as we desired. It would have been trivial to program a NO VOTE on some percentage of inputs of a given number, just for one example.

Not sure if you can tell, but I'm not a fan of electronic voting equipment. That said, how could these electronic voting device results be verified?

It would have been simple to share a report showing my device number, 413, with my vote, 7, on the screen to verify to me that my vote went through (while keeping my vote secret, since only I knew that my device number was 413).

Even if using the big screen to scroll through the more than 2,000 device IDs and votes took a few minutes, that would be completed well before the 10 minutes negotiation period for candidates to make deals back stage or in their war rooms.

Campaigns should demand audits of every round of every candidate race: secretary of state, attorney general, and governor (there was only 1 candidate for state auditor, so no voting required there). Dr. Neil Shah asked to see audits, but received no response from the MNGOP.

But the MNGOP *should* have provided these reports to every delegate in real time, if they actually cared about election integrity and wanted to model it in their own convention.

At a minimum, this would have quieted down skeptics like me whose distrust grew as I personally experienced and witnessed glitches, heard about at least one device left unattended, and watched for instance Mike Murphy lose about 60 votes between rounds 3 and 4 after taking the lead in round 3, and then about 100 votes between rounds 4 and 5.

![Mike Murphy leading in Round 3... before something changed](mike_murphy.png)

Were people really swapping their votes *away* from the leading candidate after he'd just taken the lead? Even a prominent house rep speculated about vote shaving when confronted about his vocal support for another candidate—the vote shaving was *the reason* given for his support of a different candidate. How common knowledge was this line of thinking and how grounded was the speculation? My guess is there were more attendees who put themselves in the camp of 'saboteurs' by the end of the weekend than there were at the start.

## Primary Election on August 9

I was embarrassed to reflect on the reality that in previous elections I mindlessly voted for the republican candidates but was not involved in helping to choose them. Having seen how the party puts forward candidates, and the myriad influence tactics employed, I am further embarrassed. Why? Because I was duped. I was under a spell.

Now, we have Party-endorsed candidates and unendorsed candidates, establishment-backed and grassroots-supported America First.

The stage is set.

With the context of heightened concern around voting processes and the modern electronic voting system which in Minnesota seems to violate [Minnesota Statute 206.57 Subd.6 Required Certification](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/206.57) on account of there being no testing lab identified by the EAC to conduct VVSG 2.0 certifications, we are heading into interesting territory.

But what matters more is not *who* wins, but whether the truth wins.

Will the electronic voting systems which tabulate, record, and report our vote totals be trusted? I don't think they can stand up to the pressure. Which is why so far only risk-limiting audits, not audits of the machines themselves nor the cast vote records nor a comparison of those with paper ballots has been done anywhere in Minnesota.

Once everyone recognizes the implications of that, the truth can break out into the open.

But bringing the truth out and then changing how we do things will depend in large part on you.
