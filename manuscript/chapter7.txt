# 2022 in Minnesota

## Preparation for 2022 in Minnesota

It matters a lot which candidates are on the ballot for a primary or general election. Imagine if Jeb Bush or Ted Cruz had faced off against Hillary Clinton, instead of Donald Trump. In that event, some percentage of republican voters may have stayed home. Unexciting candidates have that effect. If voters stay home a vote can be cast in their stead.

The method of putting forward unexciting candidates is also effective in state and local elections. As the media tries to get us talking about a red wave, we must stay vigilant and put forward America First candidates. It does no one any good to elect candidates who can be bought by the highest bidder or be influenced away from the principles of upholding the constitution.

QUOTED FROM OPENING OF THIS CHAPTER
In the psychological realm, in mid-2020, George Floyd dominated news cycles. Covid-19 was also a daily discussion topic on and offline. This provided distraction, air cover, and justification for procedural changes which flew in the face of existing Minnesota law.

Just as there were distractions in 2020, in the runup to the 2022 midterm elections, there has been no shortage of diversions attempted by those who wish to keep us from reclaiming our government.

This Rasmussen survey shows what voters care about versus what the media cares about:

Back in February, the beginning of the election process started in Minnesota at the precinct caucuses.

There, the key item of business is electing delegates. Those chosen in their precincts will then serve as delegates at the basic political organizing unit (BPOU) level. From there, another round of voting happens to elect delegates to the congressional district and state conventions, where endorsements occur for governor, attorney general, state auditor, and secretary of state.

Right from the jump, there were issues at the precinct caucuses.

As precinct caucuses ca

all this amounts to...

there have also been reports of tampering with the precinct delegate process and possible influence operations to position establishment candidates for the MNGOP endorsement.

We'll see, primaries are tbh the big thing and there are already issues there and in republican leadership conferences

ALL OF THIS EQUIVALENT TO INFLATING VOTER ROLLS (WITH ILLEGITIMATE VOTERS)
ALL OF THIS IS EQUIVALENT TO STUFFING BALLOT BOX

If this can happen in Otter Tail County, it can happen in any county in Minnesota. This was why some were calling for a full and transparent audit of all county delegate lists to compare with state lists prior to further BPOU and endorsing conventions. These audits did not satisfyingly occur.

I asked my BPOU Chair for an audit and the request was declined.

In Morrison County,
listen to Nathan Wesenberg's reporting

ALL OF THIS EQUIVALENT TO INFLATING VOTER ROLLS (WITH ILLEGITIMATE VOTERS)
ALL OF THIS IS EQUIVALENT TO STUFFING BALLOT BOX

EVEN A 15% TAMPERING WOULD HAVE A 30% EFFECT SIZE - JUST LIKE VOTE SWAPPING IN AN ELECTION, IF I TAKE A TRUMP VOTE AND SWAP TO BIDE, -1 TO TRUMP, +1 TO BIDEN, OR NET +2

IF YOU WERE TAMPERING WITH LISTS, YOU WERE PUTTING PEOPLE ON LIST WHO YOU **KNEW** WOULD VOTE YOUR DIRECTION, CHOOSING THE DELEGATE INSTEAD OF LETTING THEM BE VOTED UPON AS IN THE RULES AND MNGOP CONSTITUTION AND BPOU RULES, ETC.

senate district 10 endorsement convention cancelled

edwin hahn barred from senate 4 endorsement convention and participation in state convention as a delegate

who knows how many more this may have occurred to if people had spoken up about what they were seeing

erik van mechelen not allowed to participate in state convention endorsement process for secretary of state (link to video/article)
https://erikvanmechelen.substack.com/p/proposed-rule-29-to-prevent-new-sos

governor's asked to write on a sign, one word, jerk, loser, problem, take photo to persaude them to accept endorsement

according to the electronic devices at the convention, about 55% were new people, but how many *more* people should there have been without tampering? there was no transparent audit done of the statewide delegate lists which should have been done to ensure no one was left out of the process

letter from chairman david haan, calls anyone asking for paper ballots, SABOTEURS
any campaign can ask and get the next day.

at convention, another speech meant to dissuade people from standing for paper ballots - it will take too long, etc.

i asked the yellow shirted guy how things were going, who i could ask questions to about process, he pointed to the people on the stage... the mngop leadership.

then we use electronic devices, don't show many of the results.

in sos race i asked kim and kelly, neither was able to share what the result of the 2nd round was, so i'm left wondering whether kim even reached the 60% threshold. i asked eric lucero if it was normal not to show the final results, and he said it was

that may be 'how things are done' but at least in the general election we were told that Biden received 81 million votes and didn't have to take someone's word for it that he beat Trump handily.

Shah's campaign asked for audits, no answer from the party.

all this is part of election process

who wins primary becomes the party candidate, and republican candidate or democrat candidate usually win, since most voters have been funneled (through decades of influence operations) into supporting the candidate that their party puts forward.

in the recent past, as the Democrat party has moved further to the left ideologically, part of the uniparty strategy seems to be to endorse and run Republican candidates that are fairly weak and unexciting, like for example 'Low Energy Jeb'. This way, low propensity republican voters will stay home in greater numbers opening the door to the Attack Phase where mail-in ballots are submitted for them.

(Low-Energy Jeb...so low energy that I once contributed to a USA Today article... and Governor Terry McAuliffe, recently defeated by now Governor Glenn Youngkin, supposedly a win for Republicans, but in my opinion Youngkin is likely a Republican in disguise and a suitable poster child for the false assertion that in machine-driven elections the algorithms can be easily overwhelmed)

Knowing what I know now, I wouldn't do work for them again.

the endorsement is used as a marketing badge to signal

but in this environment, if a candidate could only have one, would they rather have the endorsement of their party or an endorsement from President Trump? (but also, lets not read too much into every Trump endorsement)

having seen how the party puts forward candidates, i am embarrassed. embarrassed that i previously mindlessly just voted for the candidates and was not involved in helping to choose them

also, open Primary, in Georgia, about 7% of voters in the republican primary were democrats
check this:
Congressional and state primaries: Open partisan w/ nonpartisan registration
note:
MN
    Minnesota has nonpartisan registration. There is no option to affiliate with a political party on the voter registration form.

## Endorsements

this could also happen in the minnesota primary on august 9 for select races

I think I understand your frustration with Wardlow apparently going back on his word.

In my opinion Wardlow should not have agreed to honor the endorsement: However if he had said that, likely that admission would have been used against him as well.

How *should* he have played it?

Maybe he could have learned from how Trump answered when asked in his debate vs. Biden.

Trump said if the election is fair, I’ll accept it, but if there’s fraud, I won’t.

Instead of giving a Yes/No answer which can be used against him.

Jesus, when asked if taxes should be paid to Ceasar:

Give unto Ceasar what is Ceaser’s, give unto God what is God’s.

Neil Shah asked for audits of the Rochester state convention results, which David Haan explicitly said would be available to any campaign after the convention. No response from MNGOP.

I don’t have a good feeling at all about how MNGOP ran state convention.

Am writing a bit about this in the short free book that will be ready in coming weeks.
