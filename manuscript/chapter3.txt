# Chapter Two - Attack

*"It's an organized crime. It was perpetrated on Americans by advancing bad process: dirty voter rolls, ballot boxes, all sorts of mail-in ballot capabilities. And you roll all that up and it's quite evident to those of us who've spent the last 15 months of our lives developing these numbers that this was indeed an organized crime that was perpetrated on Americans."*

—Gregg Phillips in [the informational hearing](https://www.truethevote.org/election-integrity-testimony-in-wisconsin-on-thursday-march-24-2022/)(see 32:32 time stamp) before the Assembly Committee on Campaigns and Elections in Madison, Wisconsin on March 24, 2022.

By now many are familiar with suitcases of ballots being scanned by Ruby Freeman or the truckloads of ballots being delivered to the TCF Center in Detroit. But to understand the scale of the attack on the weakest part of the American election system—absentee and mail-in ballots—let's first review a few high level statistics.

In the EAC's [2020 Election Administration and Voting Survey](https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/document_library/files/2020_EAVS_Report_Final_508c.pdf) (EAVS), the following stats are given in on page 1 of Chapter 1. Overview of Election Administration and Voting in the 2020 General election:

* More than 209 million people were active registered voters for the 2020 general election, an all-time high for the EAVS.
* Voter turnout for the 2020 general election reached the highest level documented in any EAVS thus far, at 67.7% of the citizen voting age population (CVAP). Turnout increased 6.7 percentage points from 2016 levels, and nearly all states reported an increase in turnout. More than 161 million voters cast ballots that were counted for the 2020 election.
* For the first time, a majority of voters cast their ballots before Election Day. Slightly more than 43% of voters participated with a mailed ballot, and 30.6% of ballots were cast through in-person voting before Election Day. Ballots cast on Election Day at a physical polling place comprised 30.5% of the turnout for the 2020 general election.
* The number of mailed ballots transmitted to voters more than doubled from 2016 to 2020, and the percentage of mailed ballots that were returned by voters, that were counted, and that were rejected held steady with 2016 levels.

It is now a proven fact that ballot harvesting and more critically ballot *trafficking* operations were in effect across the country throughout the 2020 election.

In Minnesota we perhaps caught a small glimpse of ballot harvesting through the Project Veritas reporting on [Ilhan-Omar connected ballot harvesting schemes](https://www.projectveritas.com/news/ilhan-omar-connected-cash-for-ballots-voter-fraud-scheme-corrupts-elections/) in September 2020. However, the ballot harvesting being done in those videos only sheds light on traditional ballot harvesting—notable but not highlighting the scale of operations likely at work in Minnesota—in that case exploiting the elderly in apartment towers for which the in-person polling place was within walking distance if not in the same building.

What True the Vote's work showed—which in my opinion was only glimpsed in documentaries like 2000 Mules—is that a likely nationwide coordinated effort to print ballots at NGOs and have them dropped off in drop boxes (or the mail) by paid mules. This is ballot *trafficking*, what Gregg Phillips called "organized crime that was perpetrated on Americans."

True the Vote's [election integrity report](https://www.truethevote.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/FILE_5193_no-meta.pdf) titled "Delivery of Absentee Ballots by Intermediaries to Milwaukee County Area Drop Boxes October 20 – November 3, 2020 was published on March 18, 2022. A week later, in Madison, Wisconsin, Catherine Engelbrecht and Gregg Phillips [gave testimony in an informational hearing](https://www.truethevote.org/election-integrity-testimony-in-wisconsin-on-thursday-march-24-2022/) before the Assembly Committee on Campaigns and Elections.

From the True the Vote (TTV) report:

"In 2021, in response to whistleblower reports, TTV began purchasing and analyzing publicly available drop box surveillance video and commercially available geospatial (mobile device) data generated at CTCL grant-funded drop box locations during the time periods in which drop boxes were in use for the 2020 General Election."

The work of True the Vote and their consultants is bringing into focus David Clements' [vote trafficking parable](https://rumble.com/vl2qbo-mike-lindell-cyber-symposium-professor-david-clements-the-vote-trafficking-.html) delivered at Mike Lindell's Cyber Symposium.

## Did Ballot Traffickers Work in Minnesota?

If Minnesota was going to be comfortably won by Biden, it stands to reason that ballot traffickers would not need to be called into action in large numbers.

But many now understand that Minnesota may well have voted in favor of President Trump on November 3rd, 2020 (and possibly in 2016, too). A simple vote trend analysis of counties like [Blue Earth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wy5WJgyNtBQ) begins to raise questions and noticing the [vote trend similarities across multiple counties](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCG2E0xbfHuBdl9DTuxkHRuvgxvO7vfjw) begs further inquiry.

![Blue Earth vote trend - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wy5WJgyNtBQ](blue_earth.png)

[Captain Seth Keshel's trends](https://rumble.com/vkf6t5-minnesota-election-audit-debrief-captain-seth-keshel.html), lawn signs, and word on the street in 2020 suggested it would be a close call and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison even seemed worried based upon his 3:57pm tweet on election day: “…We don’t have all the votes we need quite yet. So, help a friend (even a brand new friend) vote. Right now would be awesome.” Was this a signal to unleash additional mules? Or could it be—to name just one more possibility—that the epollbook system notes which voters do not vote (neither submitting an absentee/mail-in vote nor voting in person in the precinct) and adds those voters to the phantom voter pile?

![Could Ellison have had access to the SVRS in real-time on election day?](ellison_tweet.png)

Therefore do not let Biden’s official (unofficial) 7.2% margin deceive you; would Trump really have spent as much time and money here if Minnesota's 10 electoral college votes were not in play?

Now, many Minnesotans are aware their state is well known for daycare fraud and food fraud. It is emerging that voter, ballot, and election fraud are probably as prevalent, or worse, as indicated by a combination of trends, forensic analysis of Dominion systems also used in several Minnesota counties, and coordinated vote trafficking findings presented by True the Vote in the informational hearing before the Assembly Committee on Campaigns and Elections on March 24th, 2022 in Madison.

Even though Milwaukee officials failed to provide the requested video surveillance, geospatial data and cell phone signal data revealed vote or ballot trafficking into drop boxes to the tune of 137,000 ballots, or 7% of all WI ballots (in the sample, 138 people met a minimum threshold of visiting 5 NGOs and 25 drop boxes during the 2020 general election period, and 10% of that group were also present at a violent riot).

Is there any reason to believe organized ballot abuse isn’t happening a few hundred miles west here in Minnesota? (In the cab ride to the Crystal Lake VFW for [the CD5 Show](https://erikvanmechelen.substack.com/p/the-cd5-show) on Saturday April 2, 2022, the driver said he’d heard ballot harvesting and possible trafficking was happening in Minneapolis—word of mouth has long been effective but is especially powerful in our censorship-ridden world.)

Nationwide, about 160 million votes were apparently cast after experts predicted about 145 million would be. About 45% of the 160 million were absentee or mail-in ballots. In Minnesota, absentee or mail-in ballots represented 58% of the total reported votes by the secretary of state. In Minnesota, we have mail-in counties which speaks to the variance with nationwide numbers, but Minnesota's record absentee numbers may also suggest the success of the absentee voting marketing campaigns and influence operations.

The scale of absentee or mail-in ballots in Minnesota was immense. Over 1.9 million votes were apparently cast this way. That's a more than 1.2 million increase over the previous record.

Not only could absentee ballots sent to phantom voters that came back return-to-sender be collected, but NGOs may have had the ability to print ballots en masse and use mules to deliver them.

The rate at which canvassing in 30 Minnesota counties has shown that voters who reported voting in person were recorded as voting absentee raises questions.

The fact that more than 700,000 reported absentee votes were not connected to a voter in the statewide voter registration system (SVRS) 25 days after the election and only 5 days after the MN State Canvassing Board certified the election raises further questions.

Could it be that some percentage of these 700,000 reported absentee votes were coordinated by bad actors and therefore were not easily reconcilable in the electronic systems? For emphasis: 25 days after the election and 5 days after certification by the MN State Canvassing Board the numbers did not check out. And not by a little bit. By over 700,000.

The reasons for this remains an unresolved issue.

The following table with data from [Rick Weible](https://midwestswampwatch.com) shows the absentee ballots not connected by November 29th, 2020, in the MN SOS data in the Twin Cities area. Note that this work should be done immediately according to [Minnesota Statute 203B.121 BALLOT BOARDS](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/203B.121).

| County | Absentee Ballots Not Connected |
| --- | --- |
| Anoka | 4,537 |
| Hennepin | 17,830 |
| Carver | 33,741 |
| Scott | 46,220 |
| Dakota | 154,756 |
| Ramsey | 8,350 |
| Washington | 81,414 |

This is not an exhaustive list.

Furthermore, there is data gap between October 30 and November 3 which makes it difficult to audit the "must immediately" clause. The next table shows the absentee data and how it changed over time on the secretary of state's website.

| Date Requested | Quantity | Date Accepted | Quantity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 10/25/2020 | 1,765,327 | 10/23/2020 | 1,186,522 |
| 11/01/2020 | 1,969,728 | 10/30/2020 | 1,581,193 |
| 11/04/2020 | 2,129,804 | 11/03/2020 | 1,846,668 |
| 12/01/2020 | 2,129,804 | 11/03/2020 | 1,846,668 |
| 1/16/2021 | 2,193,411 | 1/14/2021 | 1,909,701 |
| 2/14/2021 | 2,193,411 | 1/14/2021 | 1,909,701 |

I've watched the room as Rick Weible has presented this data around the state. Many understand and are deeply concerned. They expect better from government especially when the issue concerns the sanctity of the elective franchise.

Minnesotans want to know whether their vote counted, whether it was cancelled out by a phantom vote, and whether a machine altered their vote.

On this last point, we turn to next in the Backup Attack Phase.

One of my friends recently asked me why a ground game as seen in 2000 Mules was needed if forensic audits can be denied and votes can be injected electronically. My simple response here is that the enemy would have preferred we not learn about the depth of cheating available through the machines. The illusions we are under need to be plausible enough, else our instincts to spot a lie kick in.

In other words, if you can cheat enough to win by inflating voter rolls and by stuffing the ballot box, you can potentially reduce the chances that people will ask questions about the machines in the first place. And those who control the machines, control who wins. Better to keep this reality under wraps.

This is part of the reason, I think, that while Hillary said she thought there was fraud in 2016, she may not have wanted to call for any audits. And history shows that she did not.
