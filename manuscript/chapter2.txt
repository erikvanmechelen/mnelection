# Chapter One - Preparation

*"The highest priority as a bad guy would be to subvert our election system. The reason is: you can take over a country without firing a shot. If you can decide who the leaders are, if you can put judges, if you can answer constitutional questions any which you want, over a period of time—you're not going to do it in one election, it's going to take a bunch of elections—but you can take over a country. And that would be my top priority (as a bad guy). Nuclear weapons would be a close second, but the top one would be elections."*

—Jeff Lenburg, nation-state vulnerability expert in the [May 9, 2022 Otero County, New Mexico Emergency meeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg6Gf6QjqGM&t=939s)

***

As hinted at in the introduction, preparation to subvert elections occurs on multiple levels, local, state, national, as well as international, not limited to the domains of law, electronic systems, and psychological operations.

In studying Minnesota election laws, one can follow the history of a particular statute over time. Did the changes to a particular statute make elections more fair or less fair? Did attempts to provide access to one vulnerable voting group such as ADA voters lead to the potential for fraud? Did judge ordered changes amount to encasing fraud within the process itself—for instance, by what metric are signatures verified? (See witness and signature requirements waived through consent decrees.)

Electronic systems must be tested, certified, and programmed prior to elections in order for them to function properly and as designed. The Election Assistance Commission certified less than 6% of Minnesota counties and certified none of its internet connected e-pollbooks. DS200s, from ES&S, were used in 65 Minnesota counties, and could easily have contained 4G wireless modems, as were found in the same model of tabulator in the Antrim County, Michigan investigation. Electronic voting equipment and election management software from Dominion and Hart also had known vulnerabilities as shown at conventions like DEFCON 27 in 2019. Minnesota participates in the Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC) which shares voter registration and other data between states, ostensibly to maintain clean voter rolls but a service which could be used to artificially inflate them. Were there any anamolies in the statewide voter registration system (SVRS) prior to or after the 2020 election in Minnesota?

In the psychological realm, in mid-2020 George Floyd dominated news cycles. Covid-19 was also a daily discussion topic on and offline. This provided distraction, air cover, and justification for procedural changes which flew in the face of existing Minnesota law. In the runup to 2022 elections, there have also been reports of tampering with the precinct delegate process and possible influence operations to position establishment candidates for the MNGOP endorsement.

## Minnesota Statutes and Law

Let's start with just a sample:

1. Election day registration allowed by [Minnesota Statute 201.061 Subd.3](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/201.061) (legal since 1974, when Minnesota became the second state to allow it)
2. Voter ID not required by law
3. Dropboxes for absentee and mail-in ballots allowed by [Minnesota Statute 203B.082](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/203B.082) (58% of 2020 votes were reportedly absentee/mail-in ballots in Minnesota)
4. LaRose v. Simon - 1) Removed witness requirements for mail voters in Primary - 2) Extended the deadline to accept mail ballots (2 days) - STIPULATION AND PARTIAL CONSENT DECREE - [Read LaRose Order 62 CV 20 3149 Order on July 31 Motions](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7012992-LaRose-Order-62-CV-20-3149-Order-on-July-31.html)
5. NAACP v. Simon - 1) Removed Witness Requirements for mail voters in General, 2) Extended the deadline to accept mail ballots (7 days), 3) MN Supreme Court Scheduled for September 3, 2020 - STIPULATION AND PARTIAL CONSENT DECREE - [Read NAACP Order 62 CV 20 3625 Order on July 31 Motions](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7012991-NAACP-Order-62-CV-20-3625-Order-on-July-31-Motions.html)
6. [This judicial complaint](https://img1.wsimg.com/blobby/go/47803963-5178-4387-9865-0ea08f5332bd/downloads/22%2003%2017%20grewing%20complaint%20with%20exhibits.pdf?ver=1648648812808) argues Judge Sarah Grewing's decision *not* to recuse herself from above cases
7. A Chair of a major political party or the Secretary of State may consult with the software vendor to hire an independent third party to inspect the source code [Minnesota Statute 206.57 Subd.6](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/206.57)

No. 3 and No. 4 were put into motion after the MN Legislature, in April 2020, rejected Secretary of State Steve Simon's request for irrevocable power to alter election law during a pandemic.

No. 7 included because to my knowledge this has not been done.

## Electronic Systems

In 2017 the Department of Homeland Security designated elections as critical infrastructure, alongside food, water, and electricity.

About three months before the election, on July 28, 2020, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) identified the following components as lacking security:

* voter registration systems
* epollbooks
* ballot preparation
* voting machines
* tabulation systems
* official websites
* storage facilities

Besides storage facilities, each of these components has undergone digitization in recent years.

Not long after the election, on November 12, 2020, CISA Assistant Director Bob Kolaksy, along with other members of the Election Infrastructure Government Coordinating Council (GCC) Executive Committee, made a joint statement declaring that "The November 3rd election was the most secure in American history... There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised."

![The most secure election, according to who?](joint_statement_CISA.png)

Rick Weible, in a workshop at the Big Lake City Hall on Wednesday May 25, 2022, pointed out that this statement could not have included a review of Minnesota, since Minnesota's Canvassing Board would not certify the election until November 24, 2020 and Minnesota's election would not be certified until early December.

Would it be unreasonable to ask Bob Kolasky how CISA's analysis which produced the Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience Note had changed between late July and mid November?

Let's take these components one at a time.

**Epollbooks**

Epollbooks are generally connected to the internet so that they can both receive a precinct-level extract of the statewide voter registration system or are at minimum a digital file if not connected or networked. The internet connection also provides for real-time updating which conceivably would have allowed our attorney general in Minnesota to make a [certain tweet at 3:57pm](https://twitter.com/keithellison/status/1323746158557253632) on election day.

In 2016, when Rick Weible was the mayor of St. Bonifacius, he first hacked into the proposed epollbook within minutes and then declined to sign a contract to use them in St. Bonifacius. His was the only city in Hennepin County *not* to use epollbooks (they used paper pollbooks) in the following election. Epollbooks are not certified by the Election Assistance Commission (EAC).

**Ballot preparation**

This is a complicated process. But Patrick Colbeck does us a favor of simplifying the complex in his book:

"Ballots are another key election infrastructure component with security vulnerabilities. Modern ballots are much more sophisticated than a piece of paper with checkboxes next to names. Today's ballots are sophisticated paper and/or digital documents. In fact, in some cases, ballots are replaced by Direct-Recording Electronic (DRE) voting machines.

"Ballot preparation is a complicated process of overlaying political geographies with the contests and candidates specific to each district and then translating those layouts into unique combinations of ballot data. Ballot preparation data takes multiple forms such as ballot images (both paper and electronic), the data files necessary to build ballot images, audio files for special use ballots, and specific files for export to external systems such as websites for Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA)-focused digital systems. Ballot preparation also generates the data necessary for tabulating votes within a voting machine and aggregating tabulated votes within a jurisdiction or state. This process is usually completed in an election documents and records management system (EDRMS), which is special software designed to manage documents and records throughout the document lifecycle, from creation to destruction. Access to the information in such systems would enable anyone attempting to subert the integrity of an election with the information necessary to create ballots independently of election officials. Of course, ballots are also where voters record their votes. Vote tallies are generated from the information on ballots therefore their integrity is very important to protect."

While Minnesota uses paper ballots in all 87 counties, we are not hand-counting them. Instead, we use voting machines.

**Voting Machines**

##A History
In the first place, how did we get to using machines, and *electronic* voting machines, in elections?

Before voting machines, voting was often done by voice throughout the 1800s. Kentucky used voice voting until 1891. The first paper ballots arrive in the early 19th century.

Then came voting machines: first lever, then punch cards.

Lever voting machines have been around a long time.

![Drawing of Voting Machine](1votingmachine.jpg)

Here’s a physical example:

![Lever Voting Machine](2votingmachine.jpg)

Punch card systems were developed in the 1960s and were last used in two Idaho counties in 2014, on [the Votomatic](https://verifiedvoting.org/election-system/ess-votomatic/) provided by ES&S.

![Punch Card System](3votingmachine.jpg)

Fast forward to the 2000 presidential election between Al Gore and George W. Bush. Hanging chads on Sequoia Voting Systems punch-card voting system led to a recount, which Bush won.

![Hanging Chads](4votingmachine.jpg)

Sequoia Voting Systems got its start in the 1970s as Mathematical Systems Corporation of Anaheim, California, offering an alternative to ES&S’s Votomatic punch cards. On March 8, 2005 Smartmatic Corp. (a Venezuelan company) acquired Sequoia. This raised eyebrows since Smartmatic had only the previous year been selected to by the Chavez-era Venezuelan government to provide voting systems for the presidential recall election, it’s [first time providing machines](https://ia801704.us.archive.org/34/items/smartmatic-sequoia-and-venezuela/Smartmatic%20Sequoia%20and%20Venezuela.pdf) for an election. As of June 4, 2010 it’s parent company was Dominion Voting Systems.

According to Sequoia’s own employees, Sequoia may have [been responsible](https://web.archive.org/web/20070928013625/http://www.votetrustusa.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2560&Itemid=51) for the defective punch cards in Florida which led to “hanging chads” or undervotes to the tune of 10,000 in Palm Beach County.

One of Sequoia’s workers [told](https://web.archive.org/web/20070928013625/http://www.votetrustusa.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2560&Itemid=51) Dan Rather:

“My own personal opinion was the touch screen voting system wasn't getting off the ground like that they—like they would hope. And because they weren't having any problems with paper ballots. So, I feel like they—deliberately did all this to have problems with the paper ballots so the electronically voting systems would get off the ground—and which it did in a big way.”

Specifically, USC 52 Ch. 209 Subchapter I—PAYMENTS TO STATES FOR ELECTION ADMINISTRATION IMPROVEMENTS AND REPLACEMENT OF PUNCH CARD AND LEVER VOTING MACHINES. §20902 states: Replacement of punch card or lever voting machines.

Sequoia benefitted from the passage of federal legislation in 2002—[the Help America Vote Act of 2002](https://www.justice.gov/crt/help-america-vote-act-2002)—because *they manufactured electronic voting equipment*.

In 2003 Beverly Harris found Diebold’s source code on the internet. Diebold had only entered the elections business a year prior through its purchase of Global Elections Systems, a touch-screen voting technology producer in Texas. The source code revealed that Diebold voting systems used an unsecured access database, meaning anyone could access, change data, and erase logs.

In 2007 Diebold Election Systems rebranded as Premier Election Solutions and in 2009 they sold to Election Systems & Software (ES&S), which by 2014 was the largest manufacturer of United States voting machines.

The [Source Code Review of the Diebold Voting System](https://jhalderm.com/pub/papers/diebold-ttbr07.pdf) was published by 6 authors on July 20, 2007, showed the system was 1) vulnerable to malicious software, 2) susceptible to viruses, 3) failed to protect ballot secrecy, and 4) vulnerable to malicious insiders.

More recently, one of the authors of the Diebold review, J. Alex Halderman of Princeton University, provided [the Halderman Declaration](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21038844-20210802-expert-rebuttal-declaration-of-j-alex-halderman) on Georgia’s ballot marking devices (BMD). Halderman has also issued a sealed [25,000-word report](https://libertysword.com/expert-hackers-25000-word-secret-report-threatens-to-uncover-georgias-real-election) on voting systems vulnerabilities.

In an emergency meeting in Otero County, New Mexico in May 2022, nation-state vulnerability expert Jeff Lensberg further detailed vulnerabilities.

##Putting the History in Context

The history of voting machines spans over 100 years. However the use of electronic voting machines is very short, only two to three decades. During almost the entirety of that duration, the electronic systems have been shown to be insecure, hackable, and manipulable, sometimes if not often by design.

Their lack of certifications is further troubling.

Col. Shawn Smith, in the Tarrant County, TX meeting in the first half of 2022:

“…And for the people who said well, the machines are certified, I would say, the space shuttle Columbia was also certified for flight. How’d that turn out? The Boeing 737 Max was certified for passenger operations, and then crashed killing over 500 people in two separate accidents before they finally let experts take a look at it. And my point in saying that is not to try to scare people, but just to say that based on my experience, and I’m not a cyber professional, but I work with cyber pros, and I know the difference between somebody who knows cyber and somebody who doesn’t. And if you don’t know the difference, then you’re in very dangerous territory when you try to make any conclusions or try to listen to someone who doesn’t really know what they’re talking about.

“Our voting systems from my perspective based on the expert examiner’s report, cannot be trusted with our election. And what they require in order to for you to verify for yourself is that you become a cyber expert. Otherwise, you’re forced to trust other people who say they’re experts, people who have conflicts of interest, and people who’ve been trained essentially by the National Association of Secretaries of State, the election directors, and the Election Assistance Commission…”

###Certifications Are Less Than Useless

Throughout its [certification process](https://www.eac.gov/voting-equipment/system-certification-process), the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) which was established by [the Help America Vote Act](https://www.eac.gov/about_the_eac/help_america_vote_act.aspx) (2002) has not certified about 95% of Minnesota counties.

Those county’s electronic voting equipment are merely certified by the Minnesota Secretary of State. The few counties that are EAC certified have the problem indicated by Col. Shawn Smith, that those certifications provide the illusion of security when in fact those systems are anything but ready to run secure elections.

Let's take a look at the certification maps. Note that being certified or not certified doesn’t guarantee system security, as we shall discuss shortly.

In the following image, Red = Certified | White = Not Certified

![USA EAC Certification Map](cert_map1.png)

If we zoom in on Minnesota, we find that only 6 of 87 counties have voting equipment that is certified by the EAC. Remember, red counties are certified, white are not certified.

![MN EAC Certification Map](certmap2.png)

Here are the counties in Minnesota that are certified by the EAC:

![County EAC Certifications](certmap3.png)

Thinking that this felt off, I called the EAC and left a voicemail and sent a question by email, which was replied to the same day (04/20/2022).

![EAC email reply](certmap4.png)

This may have been comforting if not for a close reading of Minnesota election law.

[Minnesota Statute 206.57, Subd.6](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/206.57) states in full:

Subd. 6.Required certification.

In addition to the requirements in subdivision 1, a voting system must be certified by an independent testing authority accredited by the Election Assistance Commission or appropriate federal agency responsible for testing and certification of compliance with the federal voting systems guidelines at the time of submission of the application required by subdivision 1 to be in conformity with voluntary voting system guidelines issued by the Election Assistance Commission or other previously referenced agency. The application must be accompanied by the certification report of the voting systems test laboratory. A certification under this section from an independent testing authority accredited by the Election Assistance Commission or other previously referenced agency meets the requirement of Minnesota Rules, part [8220.0350](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/rules/8220.0350/), item L. A vendor must provide a copy of the source code for the voting system to the secretary of state. A chair of a major political party or the secretary of state may select, in consultation with the vendor, an independent third-party evaluator to examine the source code to ensure that it functions as represented by the vendor and that the code is free from defects. A major political party that elects to have the source code examined must pay for the examination. Except as provided by this subdivision, a source code that is trade secret information must be treated as nonpublic information, according to [section 13.37](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/13.37). A third-party evaluator must not disclose the source code to anyone else.

It is important to note that as of now there are no other appropriate federal agencies outside of the Election Assistance Commission (EAC), which itself authorizes Pro V&V and SLI Compliance.

Are There Limits to Certifications from the EAC?

Let’s take a look at the [EAC certification for Dominion 4.14-E](https://www.dropbox.com/s/b0efp9zqshzj1cm/EAC%20Report_DVS4.14E_FinalCert_FINAL_7.2.15.pdf?dl=0).

![EAC Certification for Dominion 4.14-E](certmap5.png)

On [page 1](https://www.dropbox.com/s/b0efp9zqshzj1cm/EAC%20Report_DVS4.14E_FinalCert_FINAL_7.2.15.pdf?dl=0) note the last sentence:

“This certificate is not an endorsement of the product by any agency of the U.S. Government and no warranty of the product is either expressed or implied.”

On page 2 it reads:

![Page 2 of EAC Certification for Dominion 4.14-E](certmap6.png)

Note the second to last bullet point in “Significant of EAC Certification”:
“An EAC certification is **not**: A determination that the system is ready for use in an election.”

Then what might these certifications be for?

Are they meant to give the public a false sense of security?

Finally, compare the full [14-page EAC certification](https://www.dropbox.com/s/b0efp9zqshzj1cm/EAC%20Report_DVS4.14E_FinalCert_FINAL_7.2.15.pdf?dl=0) to the State of Minnesota Secretary of State Certification of Dominion Democracy Suite Version 4.14-E Voting System reproduced below:

![Page 1 of the State of Minnesota Secretary of State Certification of Dominion Democracy Suite Version 4.14-E Voting System](certmap7.jpeg)

And page 2 of the same:

![Page 2 of the State of Minnesota Secretary of State Certification of Dominion Democracy Suite Version 4.14-E Voting System](certmap8.jpeg)

What did you notice?

It reads very similarly, sometimes verbatim, to the EAC’s certifications, which the EAC admits do not indicate a voting machine is ready for use in an election.

###Digging Deeper (into Known Vulnerabilities)

Should the public have questions when 81 out of 87 counties in Minnesota DO NOT have certified election equipment according to the Election Assistance Commission, which under [Minnesota Statute 206.57 Subd.6](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/206.57) those election machines should have prior to use?

Are there consequences to certifications (the EAC certifications) which have disclaimers putting the value of the certification itself into question?

What *should* these certifications imply in a more common-sense world?

INSERT 4G from ch5 text

DS200s were used in more than 60 of Minnesota's 87 counties in 2020.

In April 2021, the DS200 used in Antrim, County Michigan was found to have a [4G wireless modem installed](https://letsfixstufforg-my.sharepoint.com/personal/patrick_letsfixstuff_org/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fpatrick%5Fletsfixstuff%5Forg%2FDocuments%2FFiles%2F2020%20Election%2FLegal%2FExhibit%206%20Jim%20Penrose%20Report%2Epdf&parent=%2Fpersonal%2Fpatrick%5Fletsfixstuff%5Forg%2FDocuments%2FFiles%2F2020%20Election%2FLegal&ga=1) within the enclosure of the machine.

![Telit LE910-SV1 found within ES&S enclosure](telit.png)

Furthermore, [the exhibit describes](https://letsfixstufforg-my.sharepoint.com/personal/patrick_letsfixstuff_org/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fpatrick%5Fletsfixstuff%5Forg%2FDocuments%2FFiles%2F2020%20Election%2FLegal%2FExhibit%206%20Jim%20Penrose%20Report%2Epdf&parent=%2Fpersonal%2Fpatrick%5Fletsfixstuff%5Forg%2FDocuments%2FFiles%2F2020%20Election%2FLegal&ga=1) how the card was "utilizing a commercial Verizon SIM card with an APN configuration specific to the ES&S DS200 provisioning. Testing revealed that the same SIM card could be utilized in a separate wireless hotspot device and the device could then join the same APN as the ES&S voting machines. An unauthorized user could gain access to this APN by an extra SIM card pre-provisioned for this APN, or by removing a SIM from an operational device and using it in another device."

To repeat: This wireless modem was found on an enclosed part of the machine. Therefore if these same or similar wireless modems were also installed on the DS200s throughout Minnesota, it would be invisible to election judges, poll challengers, and even election officials.

Dr. Douglas Frank [has called the ES&S DS200](https://t.me/FollowTheData/1985) "one of the most hackable ballot scanners in the country". It was in use in 65 Minnesota counties in 2020.

To make matters worse, however, there are indications that the DS200's ability to generate a Cast Vote Record (CVR) report was turned off via a configuration which returns the DS200 to the Model 100 configuration.

![Configurations matter](ess_configuration.png)

This would have been done prior to the election. If this configuration change was made across most counties using the DS200, DS450, and DS850, this adjustment may have prevented voters from learning whether the machine-recorded vote tallies matched their paper ballot submissions. This configuration decision would explain responses from county election officials and letters like this one from the Todd County Attorney.

![The opinion of the Todd County Attorney](todd_county_atty_opinion.png)

While some counties seem to be using dated Model 100 configurations (on their DS200 scanners), Saint Louis County recently purchased [the DS950](https://www.essvote.com/products/ds950/), one of the newest electronic voting machines on the market, likely costing about $250,000.

In 2020, several Minnesota counties used the DS450 and DS850. While county commissioners in other states have described these machines as being built in Omaha, Nebraska, both the DS450 and DS850 are made in Germany.

## Tabulation Systems

In the [3/15/2022 Nye County, Nevada County Commissioner’s meeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=234&v=GBKz1o_VqAE&feature=youtu.be) cyber security consultant Mark Cook [described his experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKz1o_VqAE&t=234s) with computers pre-internet in the CompuServe and Prodigy days, then as a consultant to protect companies from threats and seal off vulnerability, and finally with election systems.

Today, Dominion is a popular voting system which uses Microsoft SQL database, one which Mark was and is very familiar with as he used SQL databases from day 1. In the same meeting, he discussed how within the first minute of getting his hands on a Dominion system, he was able to access the backend and change votes without leaving a trace.

As has now been shown, certifications (and the lack of certifications) have not protected the right of men and women to vote freely and fairly in this country. For just one example, the [Mesa County Colorado Voting Systems Report #3: Election Database and Data Process Analysis](https://magaraccoon.com/docs/MesaCountyReport3.pdf) proves database manipulation happened inside the Colorado Dominion Voting Systems (DVS) Election Management System (EMS). Not once, but twice, in both the 2020 General Election and the 2021 Grand Junction Municipal Election.

Fortunately, there are signs around the country that people are becoming aware of the fundamental issue (that these machines are designed to allow manipulation) and using their voice to affect change how their county conducts elections. Yesterday, April 19, 2022, men and women spoke in Crow Wing, Dakota, and Sherburne counties ([video from Sherburne](https://erikvanmechelen.substack.com/p/open-forum-speakers-address-removing)). Recently, two counties in Nevada, Nye and Esmeralda have already decided not to use electronic voting equipment in upcoming elections. Which county commissioners will be the first in Minnesota to do the same and restore the voice that is constitutionally inherent in the right to vote to their constituents?

Inflated rolls facilitate ballot mules and support machine manipulation. It seems plausible that non-profits like the <a href="https://ericstates.org/" target=_new>Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC)</a> provide support to states using inflated rolls through "reports that show voters who have moved within their state, voters who have moved out of state, voters who have died, duplicate registrations in the same state, and individuals who are potentially eligible to vote but are not yet registered." For instance, if member states like Minnesota do not remove voters who have moved out of state or have died, then the result is an inflated voter roll. Even if the dead or out of state voter votes, that vote technically counts since that individual will be on the statewide voter registration system with a voter ID in the system.
</p><p>
How do we know that voter rolls are inflated, providing an ample supply of ready-to-launch voters?
</p><p>
Voter rolls and histories are public information that you can request from the <a href="https://www.sos.state.mn.us/election-administration-campaigns/data-maps/registered-voter-list-requests/" target=_new>Minnesota Secretary of State's website</a> for $46. Note that your request is made at a particular moment in time. However, if you request a list before and after an election, as people like <a href="https://midwestswampwatch.com" target=_new>Rick Weible</a> did for the November 3rd, 2020 General Election, and you are handy with database management (these are big files) then you can see how the lists changed. If you were to continue to request lists every few weeks, then you could see how the lists change over time, sometimes dramatically. (Going forward, it should not require experts in database management to hold our government accountable.)
</p><p>
It was these voter rolls and histories that allowed Rick Weible to discover that more than 700,000 Minnesota ballots were not yet connected to a voter on November 29, 2020, only 25 days after the election and a mere 5 days after the Minnesota State Canvassing Board <a href="https://www.sos.state.mn.us/about-the-office/news-room/state-canvassing-board-certifies-results-of-2020-general-election/" target=_new>certified the results</a> of the 2020 General Election. Should the Board have certified the results if the work required by Minnesota statutes was not yet complete?

## Election Process, Rules, and Procedues

DATE - MN Legislature Rejected SOS Steve Simon’s Request for Irrovacable Power to Alter Election Law During a Pandemic. (This fact differentiates MN from other states.)

LaRose v. Simon filed - Democrat activists’ groups filed suits against Democrat MN SOS demanding the changes to the law he had sought. Ignoring the MN Constitution and Separation of Power issues, MN SOS Simon, represented by Democrat AG Ellison, entered into consent decrees with their supporters to obliterate long-standing election law. The MNGOP via its attorney failed to intervene in a timely manner. The consent decree was approved by the court prior to the first hearing on the matter. (These overly broad consent decrees later approved by judges.) - SUITS FILED

NAACP v. Simon filed

LaRose v. Simon - 1) Removed witness requirements for mail voters in Primary - 2) Extended the deadline to accept mail ballots (2 days) - STIPULATION AND PARTIAL CONSENT DECREE

NAACP v. Simon - 1) Removed Witness Requirements for mail voters in General, 2) Extended the deadline to accept mail ballots (7 days), 3) MN Supreme Court Scheduled for September 3, 2020 - STIPULATION AND PARTIAL CONSENT DECREE

LaRose Order 62 CV 20 3149 Order on July 31 Motions - ORDER

## Psychology

QUOTED FROM OPENING OF THIS CHAPTER
In the psychological realm, in mid-2020 George Floyd dominated news cycles. Covid-19 was also a daily discussion topic on and offline. This provided distraction, air cover, and justification for procedural changes which flew in the face of existing Minnesota law. In the runup to 2022 elections, there have also been reports of tampering with the precinct delegate process and possible influence operations to position establishment candidates for the MNGOP endorsement.

We'll see, primaries are tbh the big thing and there are already issues there and in republican leadership conferences

governor's asked to write on a sign, one word, jerk, loser, problem, take photo to persaude them to accept endorsement

according to the electronic devices at the convention, about 55% were new people, but how many *more* people should there have been without tampering? there was no transparent audit done of the statewide delegate lists which should have been done to ensure no one was left out of the process

letter from chairman david haan, calls anyone asking for paper ballots, SABOTEURS
any campaign can ask and get the next day.

at convention, another speech meant to dissuade people from standing for paper ballots - it will take too long, etc.

i asked the yellow shirted guy how things were going, who i could ask questions to about process, he pointed to the people on the stage... the mngop leadership.

then we use electronic devices, don't show many of the results.

in sos race i asked kim and kelly, neither was able to share what the result of the 2nd round was, so i'm left wondering whether kim even reached the 60% threshold. i asked eric lucero if it was normal not to show the final results, and he said it was

that may be 'how things are done' but at least in the general election we were told that Biden received 81 million votes and didn't have to take someone's word for it that he beat Trump handily.

remember this - https://erikformn.us/action.html

Shah's campaign asked for audits, no answer from the party.

all this is part of election process

who wins primary becomes the party candidate, and republican candidate or democrat candidate usually win, since most voters have been funneled (through decades of influence operations) into supporting the candidate that their party puts forward.

in the recent past, as the Democrat party has moved further to the left ideologically, part of the uniparty strategy seems to be to endorse and run Republican candidates that are fairly weak and unexciting, like for example 'Low Energy Jeb'. This way, low propensity republican voters will stay home in greater numbers opening the door to the Attack Phase where mail-in ballots are submitted for them.

(Low-Energy Jeb...so low energy that I once contributed to a USA Today article... and Governor Terry McAuliffe, recently defeated by now Governor Glenn Youngkin, supposedly a win for Republicans, but in my opinion Youngkin is likely a Republican in disguise and a suitable poster child for the false assertion that in machine-driven elections the algorithms can be easily overwhelmed)

Knowing what I know now, I wouldn't do work for them again.

the endorsement is used as a marketing badge to signal

but in this environment, if a candidate could only have one, would they rather have the endorsement of their party or an endorsement from President Trump? (but also, lets not read too much into every Trump endorsement)

having seen how the party puts forward candidates, i am embarrassed. embarrassed that i previously mindlessly just voted for the candidates and was not involved in helping to choose them

also, open Primary, in Georgia, about 7% of voters in the republican primary were democrats
