# Chapter One - Preparation

*"The highest priority as a bad guy would be to subvert our election system. The reason is: you can take over a country without firing a shot. If you can decide who the leaders are, if you can put judges, if you can answer constitutional questions any which you want, over a period of time—you're not going to do it in one election, it's going to take a bunch of elections—but you can take over a country. And that would be my top priority (as a bad guy). Nuclear weapons would be a close second, but the top one would be elections."*

—Jeff Lenburg, nation-state vulnerability expert in the [May 9, 2022 Otero County, New Mexico Emergency meeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg6Gf6QjqGM&t=939s)

***

As hinted at in the introduction, preparation to subvert elections occurs on multiple levels, local, state, national, as well as international, not limited to the domains of law, electronic systems, and psychological operations.

In studying Minnesota election laws, one can follow the history of a particular statute over time. Did the changes to a particular statute make elections more fair or less fair? Did attempts to provide access to one vulnerable voting group such as ADA voters lead to the potential for fraud? Did judge ordered changes amount to encasing fraud within the process itself—for instance, by what metric are signatures verified? (See witness and signature requirements waived through consent decrees.)

Electronic systems must be tested, certified, and programmed prior to elections in order for them to function properly and as designed. The Election Assistance Commission certified less than 6% of Minnesota counties and certified none of its internet connected e-pollbooks. DS200s, from ES&S, were used in 65 Minnesota counties, and could easily have contained 4G wireless modems, as were found in the same model of tabulator in the Antrim County, Michigan investigation. Electronic voting equipment and election management software from Dominion and Hart also had known vulnerabilities as shown at conventions like DEFCON 27 in 2019. Minnesota participates in the Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC) which shares voter registration and other data between states, ostensibly to maintain clean voter rolls but a service which could be used to artificially inflate them. Were there any anamolies in the statewide voter registration system (SVRS) prior to or after the 2020 election in Minnesota?

In the psychological realm, in mid-2020 George Floyd dominated news cycles. Covid-19 was also a daily discussion topic on and offline. This provided distraction, air cover, and justification for procedural changes which flew in the face of existing Minnesota law.

## Minnesota Statutes and Law

Let's start with just a sample:

1. Election day registration allowed by [Minnesota Statute 201.061 Subd.3](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/201.061) (legal since 1974, when Minnesota became the second state to allow it)
2. Voter ID not required by law
3. Dropboxes for absentee and mail-in ballots allowed by [Minnesota Statute 203B.082](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/203B.082) (58% of 2020 votes were reportedly absentee/mail-in ballots in Minnesota)
4. LaRose v. Simon - 1) Removed witness requirements for mail voters in Primary - 2) Extended the deadline to accept mail ballots (2 days) - STIPULATION AND PARTIAL CONSENT DECREE - [Read LaRose Order 62 CV 20 3149 Order on July 31 Motions](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7012992-LaRose-Order-62-CV-20-3149-Order-on-July-31.html)
5. NAACP v. Simon - 1) Removed Witness Requirements for mail voters in General, 2) Extended the deadline to accept mail ballots (7 days), 3) MN Supreme Court Scheduled for September 3, 2020 - STIPULATION AND PARTIAL CONSENT DECREE - [Read NAACP Order 62 CV 20 3625 Order on July 31 Motions](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7012991-NAACP-Order-62-CV-20-3625-Order-on-July-31-Motions.html)
6. [This judicial complaint](https://img1.wsimg.com/blobby/go/47803963-5178-4387-9865-0ea08f5332bd/downloads/22%2003%2017%20grewing%20complaint%20with%20exhibits.pdf?ver=1648648812808) argues Judge Sarah Grewing's decision *not* to recuse herself from above cases
7. A Chair of a major political party or the Secretary of State may consult with the software vendor to hire an independent third party to inspect the source code [Minnesota Statute 206.57 Subd.6](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/206.57)

No. 3 and No. 4 were put into motion after the MN Legislature, in April 2020, rejected Secretary of State Steve Simon's request for irrevocable power to alter election law during a pandemic.

No. 7 included because to my knowledge this has not been done.

## Electronic Systems

In 2017 the Department of Homeland Security designated elections as critical infrastructure, alongside food, water, and electricity.

About three months before the election, on July 28, 2020, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) identified the following components as lacking security:

* voter registration systems
* epollbooks
* ballot preparation
* voting machines
* tabulation systems
* official websites
* storage facilities

Besides storage facilities, each of these components has undergone digitization in recent years.

Not long after the election, on November 12, 2020, CISA Assistant Director Bob Kolaksy, along with other members of the Election Infrastructure Government Coordinating Council (GCC) Executive Committee, made a joint statement declaring that "The November 3rd election was the most secure in American history... There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised."

![The most secure election, according to who?](joint_statement_CISA.png)

Rick Weible, in a workshop at the Big Lake City Hall on Wednesday May 25, 2022, pointed out that this statement could not have included a review of Minnesota, since Minnesota's Canvassing Board would not certify the election until November 24, 2020 and Minnesota's election would not be certified until early December.

Would it be unreasonable to ask Bob Kolasky how CISA's analysis which produced the Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience Note had changed between late July and mid November?

Let's take these components one at a time.

**Epollbooks**

Epollbooks are generally connected to the internet so that they can both receive a precinct-level extract of the statewide voter registration system or are at minimum a digital file if not connected or networked. The internet connection also provides for real-time updating which conceivably would have allowed our attorney general in Minnesota to make a [certain tweet at 3:57pm](https://twitter.com/keithellison/status/1323746158557253632) on election day.

In 2016, when Rick Weible was the mayor of St. Bonifacius, he first hacked into the proposed epollbook within minutes and then declined to sign a contract to use them in St. Bonifacius. His was the only city in Hennepin County *not* to use epollbooks (they used paper pollbooks) in the following election. Epollbooks are not certified by the Election Assistance Commission (EAC).

**Ballot preparation**

This is a complicated process. But Patrick Colbeck does us a favor of simplifying the complex in his book:

"Ballots are another key election infrastructure component with security vulnerabilities. Modern ballots are much more sophisticated than a piece of paper with checkboxes next to names. Today's ballots are sophisticated paper and/or digital documents. In fact, in some cases, ballots are replaced by Direct-Recording Electronic (DRE) voting machines.

"Ballot preparation is a complicated process of overlaying political geographies with the contests and candidates specific to each district and then translating those layouts into unique combinations of ballot data. Ballot preparation data takes multiple forms such as ballot images (both paper and electronic), the data files necessary to build ballot images, audio files for special use ballots, and specific files for export to external systems such as websites for Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA)-focused digital systems. Ballot preparation also generates the data necessary for tabulating votes within a voting machine and aggregating tabulated votes within a jurisdiction or state. This process is usually completed in an election documents and records management system (EDRMS), which is special software designed to manage documents and records throughout the document lifecycle, from creation to destruction. Access to the information in such systems would enable anyone attempting to subert the integrity of an election with the information necessary to create ballots independently of election officials. Of course, ballots are also where voters record their votes. Vote tallies are generated from the information on ballots therefore their integrity is very important to protect."

While Minnesota uses paper ballots in all 87 counties, we are not hand-counting them. Instead, we use voting machines.

**Voting Machines**

In the Introduction we already discussed the potential presence of 4G wireless modems in an enclosure of the DS200s used in the majority of Minnesota's 87 counties.

Here is a table of electronic voting equipment used in the 2020 general election, provided by Dan Sundin who pulled this information from the county websites.

Dr. Douglas Frank [has called the ES&S DS200](https://t.me/FollowTheData/1985) "one of the most hackable ballot scanners in the country". It was in use in 65 Minnesota counties in 2020.

To make matters worse, however, there are indications that the DS200's ability to generate a Cast Vote Record (CVR) report was turned off via a configuration which returns the DS200 to the Model 100 configuration.

![Configurations matter](ess_configuration.png)

This would have been done prior to the election. If this configuration change was made across most counties using the DS200, DS450, and DS850, this adjustment may have prevented voters from learning whether the machine-recorded vote tallies matched their paper ballot submissions. This configuration decision would explain responses from county election officials and letters like this one from the Todd County Attorney.

![The opinion of the Todd County Attorney](todd_county_atty_opinion.png)

While some counties seem to be using dated Model 100 configurations (on their DS200 scanners), Saint Louis County recently purchased [the DS950](https://www.essvote.com/products/ds950/), one of the newest electronic voting machines on the market, likely costing about $250,000.

In 2020, several Minnesota counties used the DS450 and DS850. While county commissioners in other states have described these machines as being built in Omaha, Nebraska, both the DS450 and DS850 are made in Germany.

Inflated rolls facilitate ballot mules and support machine manipulation. It seems plausible that non-profits like the <a href="https://ericstates.org/" target=_new>Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC)</a> provide support to states using inflated rolls through "reports that show voters who have moved within their state, voters who have moved out of state, voters who have died, duplicate registrations in the same state, and individuals who are potentially eligible to vote but are not yet registered." For instance, if member states like Minnesota do not remove voters who have moved out of state or have died, then the result is an inflated voter roll. Even if the dead or out of state voter votes, that vote technically counts since that individual will be on the statewide voter registration system with a voter ID in the system.
</p><p>
How do we know that voter rolls are inflated, providing an ample supply of ready-to-launch voters?
</p><p>
Voter rolls and histories are public information that you can request from the <a href="https://www.sos.state.mn.us/election-administration-campaigns/data-maps/registered-voter-list-requests/" target=_new>Minnesota Secretary of State's website</a> for $46. Note that your request is made at a particular moment in time. However, if you request a list before and after an election, as people like <a href="https://midwestswampwatch.com" target=_new>Rick Weible</a> did for the November 3rd, 2020 General Election, and you are handy with database management (these are big files) then you can see how the lists changed. If you were to continue to request lists every few weeks, then you could see how the lists change over time, sometimes dramatically. (Going forward, it should not require experts in database management to hold our government accountable.)
</p><p>
It was these voter rolls and histories that allowed Rick Weible to discover that more than 700,000 Minnesota ballots were not yet connected to a voter on November 29, 2020, only 25 days after the election and a mere 5 days after the Minnesota State Canvassing Board <a href="https://www.sos.state.mn.us/about-the-office/news-room/state-canvassing-board-certifies-results-of-2020-general-election/" target=_new>certified the results</a> of the 2020 General Election. Should the Board have certified the results if the work required by Minnesota statutes was not yet complete?

## Election Process, Rules, and Procedues

DATE - MN Legislature Rejected SOS Steve Simon’s Request for Irrovacable Power to Alter Election Law During a Pandemic. (This fact differentiates MN from other states.)

LaRose v. Simon filed - Democrat activists’ groups filed suits against Democrat MN SOS demanding the changes to the law he had sought. Ignoring the MN Constitution and Separation of Power issues, MN SOS Simon, represented by Democrat AG Ellison, entered into consent decrees with their supporters to obliterate long-standing election law. The MNGOP via its attorney failed to intervene in a timely manner. The consent decree was approved by the court prior to the first hearing on the matter. (These overly broad consent decrees later approved by judges.) - SUITS FILED

NAACP v. Simon filed

LaRose v. Simon - 1) Removed witness requirements for mail voters in Primary - 2) Extended the deadline to accept mail ballots (2 days) - STIPULATION AND PARTIAL CONSENT DECREE

NAACP v. Simon - 1) Removed Witness Requirements for mail voters in General, 2) Extended the deadline to accept mail ballots (7 days), 3) MN Supreme Court Scheduled for September 3, 2020 - STIPULATION AND PARTIAL CONSENT DECREE

LaRose Order 62 CV 20 3149 Order on July 31 Motions - ORDER

NAACP Order 62 CV 20 3625 Order on July 31 Motions - ORDER

Absentee voting period - Vote by mail or in person
