Minnesota No. 1 in Voter ~~Turnout~~ Fraud

EDIT: remove sensationalism and sentimentality

I should have taken the September 2020 Project Veritas video about the Ilhan Omar-connected ballot harvesting scheme in Minneapolis as a sign to pay closer attention to the upcoming election. Fortunately mistakes can be learned from and put in a context which produces awareness for proper future action. Even to the point that minor mistakes are welcomed as a reality test and recalibration. But even though I went to bed early on 3 November, around 9:30 p.m., having read that the absentee ballots by the books would not need to be fully counted in battleground states on election night, when I awoke on 4 November I was nevertheless unsettled by what I came to understand happened in the early morning hours. But I didn’t have much time to dig in as we were paying a visit to my wife’s childhood friend’s family in State College, Pennsylvania the next day.

There, we were treated by our hosts to hours of uninterrupted and uncensored CNN coverage (as in 1984 the TV loomed ever-present in the background) detailing for instance Biden’s remarkable comeback turning a midnight Pennsylvania deficit of 555,189 votes into a tighter race. Attention everyone, let’s keep counting absentee ballots as long as it takes! On Saturday 7 November at 11:25 a.m. the Associated Press called the state for Biden—what gives any media outlet the authority to ‘call’ a race?—holding a 34,243 vote lead (by 15 December that was extended to a 81,660 vote margin). We were driving to the trailhead of the Thousand Steps on Jacks Mountain when my wife’s friend saw this notification and excitedly shared the news, which enlivened the mood for others in the car. I hiked peacefully enough as it really was a beautiful and sunny autumn day, however even a dip in a cold lake that afternoon could not lower my temperature enough to prevent my pent up anger spilling out that evening in an argument about whether skin color mattered relative to so many other dimensions of a human. I did not back down from but nor did I love my enemy that night. It made for an awkward breakfast the next morning where it was suggested that I might have done better to model my approach to conversation after the people of Japan, who my host had concluded on his trip there prioritize respect and politeness. The substance of the argument we had, though, has yet to be taken up. Moms and dads across the country have since made it clear in school board meetings that they understand critical race theory itself to be racist and therefore an inappropriate ideology to be peddled in publicly funded schools. At this point in my anecdote, however, I bet you haven’t failed to notice what else wasn’t said. By me.

For some reason I wasn’t ready to speak up about the election.

Meanwhile, the mainstream media was not giving up on the coverup.

Trump's lawsuits. No standing. The President of the United States had no standing. Therefore evidence wasn't shown because the vast majority of these cases didn't reach the evidentiary stage.

Early on, the media seemed to ignore election fraud news, but in February The Times went a different route. An article on the shadow campaign that saved the election included this already infamous sentence: “That’s why the participants want the secret history of the 2020 election told, even though it sounds like a paranoid fever dream—a well-funded cabal of powerful people, ranging across industries and ideologies, working together behind the scenes to influence perceptions, change rules and laws, steer media coverage and control the flow of information. They were not rigging the election; they were fortifying it.”

The fact that this article was written and published is one of many bizarre events I've noted in recent months. What these sentences describe is quite close to what happened.

Because to some extent the well funded cabal has succeeded in controlling the flow of information, the truth—including significant election-changing evidence—has taken time and effort to emerge.






Why did it take me so long to arrive in a place where I had developed the internal constitution to honestly investigate issues for myself? Why only then was I determined to think as clearly as possible while also tuning into my intuition on vital issues?

Minnesota No. 1 in Voter ~~Turnout~~ Fraud

Even in May 2022, a good number of Minnesotans understand elections are rigged but don't understand that they can be rigged to the extent that Trump won Minnesota in 2020, probably comfortably.


"Not since the Manhattan Project, which developed the Atom Bomb, have so many smart people worked together to solve such a critical problem."</em> – in <a href="https://magaraccoon.com/desk/raccoondesk5.pdf" target=_new>this letter</a> by Jeffrey O'Donnell, one of the authors of the <a href="https://magaraccoon.com/docs/MesaCountyReport3.pdf" target=_new>Mesa County Colorado Voting Systems Report #3</a> on Election Database and Process Analysis of Dominion Voting Systems (DVS) Election Management System (EMS)







In early 2021 A friend of mine said I should watch a video interivew between Robert David Steele and Martin Geddes. This introduced me to the Q posts and got me onto Telegram.

By summer, although still working on client books, I was getting restless. A number of influencers on Telegram had said things would be cleaned up soon and Trump would be reinserted. As dates came and went, I decided I had to do something.

First I tried to go to work for Project Veritas. When that didn't work out, I found an online group on Telegram whose stated mission was to produce audits in Minnesota.

Early on, I volunteered to help moderate the chat room. Soon after, I was asked to be the lead for communications. There was also a lead for freedom of information act (FOIA) requests, documents, and research. At first there was one admin, who oversaw everything and was the liason to the national leaders. Later, she was removed and two admins were put in place. I didn't speak with any of the national leaders until a few days before I decided to leave this group about 45 days after I joined it.

Several of the relationships formed in this mostly anonymous group were maintained and became valuable.

One person, Molly mentions Rick and Midwest Swamp Watch.

Still, though, I didn't go to a presentation until October 2021. (Brought camera... )

Writing in Markdown is easy! You can learn most of what you need to know with just a few examples.

To make *italic text* you surround it with single asterisks. To make **bold text** you surround it with double asterisks.

## Section One

You can start new sections by starting a line with two # signs and a space, and then typing your section title.

### Sub-Section One

You can start new sub-sections by starting a line with three # signs and a space, and then typing your sub-section title.

## Including a Chapter in the Sample Book

At the top of this file, you will also see a line at the top that says `{sample: true}`, immediately above the # Chapter Two title. This means that when you generate a preview of your book, or publish a new version of your book, this chapter will be included in a separate sample book that will be created. When you publish your book, this will give potential readers a sample book to read, when they are deciding whether they want to buy your book.

## Links

You can add web links easily. Here is a link to the [Leanpub homepage](https://leanpub.com).

When you are creating a web link, the part between the square brackets [ ] contains the words that people will see in your book, and the part in the round brackets ( ) is the web address you are linking to.

## Images

You can add an image to your book in a similar way.

First, add the image to the "resources" folder for your book. You will find the "resources" folder in your book's "manuscript" folder, which is at the top level of your book's folder in GitHub or Bitbucket.

If you look in your book's "resources" folder right now, you will see that there is an example image there with the file name "palm-trees.jpg". Here's how you can add this image to your book:

![Palm Trees](palm-trees.jpg)

As this example image shows, **on a line by itself** you type an exclamation point !, followed by the image caption between square brackets and the filename between round brackets.

To learn more about adding images, see [this link](https://leanpub.com/markua/read#images).

## Lists

### Numbered Lists

You make a numbered list like this:

1. kale
2. carrot
3. ginger

### Bulleted Lists

You make a bulleted list like this:

* kale
* carrot
* ginger

## Code Samples

You can add code samples really easily. Code can be in separate files (a "local" resource) or in the manuscript itself (an "inline" resource).

### Local Code Samples

Here's a local code resource:

{format: ruby}
![Hello World in Ruby](hello.rb)

### Inline Code Samples

Inline code samples can either be spans or figures.

A span looks like `puts "hello world"` this.

A figure looks like this:

```ruby
puts "hello"
```

You can also add a caption:

{caption: "Hello World in Ruby"}
```ruby
puts "hello"
```

To learn more about adding code samples, see [this link](https://leanpub.com/markua/read#code).

## Tables

You can insert tables easily inline, using the GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) table syntax:

| Header 1  | Header 2 |
| --- | --- |
| Content 1 | Content 2 |
| Content 3 | Content 4 Can be Different Length |

To learn more about adding tables, see [this link](https://leanpub.com/markua/read#tables).

## Math

You can easily insert math equations inline using either spans or figures.

Here's one of the kinematic equations `d = v_i t + \frac{1}{2} a t^2`$ inserted as a span inside a sentence.

Here's some math inserted as a figure.

{caption: "Something Involving Sums"}
```latexmath
\left|\sum_{i=1}^n a_ib_i\right|
\le
\left(\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2\right)^{1/2}
\left(\sum_{i=1}^n b_i^2\right)^{1/2}
```

To learn more about adding math, see [this link](https://leanpub.com/markua/read#math).

## How Book.txt Works

If you look in your book's "manuscript" folder, you will see there is a file called "Book.txt".

The "Book.txt" file is what our book generators use to decide what other files to include in your book. It is a list of the files in your "manuscript" folder that you decide you want to include in your book.

You can have multiple chapters in one file, but we recommend one chapter per file. This way, it's easier to navigate.

If you open the "Book.txt" file now, you will see the following list:

chapter1.txt
chapter2.txt
chapter3.docx
chapter4.docx

If you want to write in plain text, you should delete the following lines in the "Book.txt" file, and save the change:

chapter3.docx
chapter4.docx

(Those files are for people who want to write in Word, not in plain text.)

Now, the only two lines listed in the "Book.txt" file will be:

chapter1.txt
chapter2.txt

The next time you create generate a preview of your book, our book generators will only use the "chapter1.txt" and the "chapter2.txt" files, because they are the only files listed in the "Book.txt" file. Our book generators will ignore any files in your "manuscript" folder that are not listed in the "Book.txt" file, even if those other files are still in the "manuscript" folder.

## Creating a Preview of Your Book

You can generate a new version of your book any time by going to the "Preview" page for your book on Leanpub.

To go to the Preview page for your book, click on the Versions tab on Leanpub when you are working on your book. By default you will be taken to the "Preview New Version" page, which is where you'll be able to preview your book.

## Getting Help

Finally, to get help, go to the Help tab for your book in Leanpub and then either...

1. See our Getting Started page to learn how to get started.
2. See our Getting Help page to learn how to get help.
3. Clicking the link to the [Markua manual](https://leanpub.com/markua/read) on the Getting Help page. The Markua manual contains everything you need to know about writing in Markdown on Leanpub. (Our dialect of Markdown is called Markua.)

By the way, that was how you make a numbered list in Markdown.

You can also make a bulleted list like this:

* item one
* the second item
* another item

We hope that you find writing in Markdown on Leanpub to be simple and enjoyable!
