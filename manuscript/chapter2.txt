# Chapter One - Preparation

*"The highest priority as a bad guy would be to subvert our election system. The reason is: you can take over a country without firing a shot. If you can decide who the leaders are, if you can put judges, if you can answer constitutional questions any which you want, over a period of time—you're not going to do it in one election, it's going to take a bunch of elections—but you can take over a country. And that would be my top priority (as a bad guy). Nuclear weapons would be a close second, but the top one would be elections."*

—Jeff Lenberg, nation-state vulnerability expert in the [May 9, 2022 Otero County, New Mexico Emergency meeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg6Gf6QjqGM&t=939s)

***

As noted in the introduction, 2020 was filled with what could be called distractions but in reality were outright attacks on the American people. While those occurred, the preparation phase was shaping the battlefield. Published in 1999, a translated version of the original People's Liberation Army documents, [*Un-Restricted Warfare*](https://www.amazon.com/Unrestricted-Warfare-Chinas-Destroy-America/dp/1626543054), by Col. Qiao Liang and Col. Wang Xiangsui provides context for how the George Floyd incident might relate to or be part of the same attack upon our country. In particular, chapter 7: Ten Thousand Methods Combined as One: Combinations That Transcend Boundaries, the authors argue for the necessity to exceed the previous limitations of warfare, perhaps in Machiavellian fashion going beyond those laid down in [*The United States Department of Defense Law of War Manual*](https://projectapario.com/Browse?document=DQTBLMQK9&filename=DoD%20Law%20of%20War%20Manual%20-%20June%202015%20Updated%20Dec%202016.pdf), a guide to international humanitarian law. Qiao and Wang go on to discuss supra-national combinations, that is efforts that include national, international, and non-state organizations.

Preparation to subvert elections occurs on multiple levels, local, state, national, as well as international, not limited to the domains of law, electronic systems, and psychological operations. The unraveling of this national election theft is likely to take some time; it's implications may be difficult for some of us to comprehend, but try we must.

Subversion can occur legally or illegally, constitutionally or unconstitutionally, ethically or unethically, by individuals or by coordinated groups. In the pages that follow, bear in mind that the mere fact that something is legal does not make it right. In the elections domain, a statute could be well intentioned but in practice weaken the fairness or transparency of an election. Just because ballot dropboxes found their way into state statute in a bi-partisan manner does not dropboxes a friend of fair elections.

In studying Minnesota election laws, one can follow the history of a particular statute over time. Did the changes to a particular statute make elections more fair or less fair? Did attempts to provide access to one vulnerable voting group such as ADA voters lead to the potential for fraud? Did judge ordered changes amount to encasing fraud within the process itself—for instance, by what metric are signatures verified? Did the waiving of witness and signature requirements for absentee ballots make it more convenient for voters? Probably. But it also opened the door to ballot trafficking rings discovered by Gregg Phillips and Catherine Engelbrecht, highlighted in the documentary 2000 Mules.

Electronic systems must be tested, certified, and programmed prior to elections in order for them to function properly and as designed. The Election Assistance Commission certified [less than 6% of Minnesota counties](https://erikvanmechelen.substack.com/p/only-6-out-of-87-counties-in-minnesota) and certified none of its internet connected e-pollbooks. The DS200, a scanner and tabulator from ES&S, was used in 65 Minnesota counties, and could easily have contained 4G wireless modems, as were found in the same model of tabulator in [the Antrim County, Michigan investigation](https://www.depernolaw.com/uploads/2/7/0/2/27029178/ex_5-10.pdf) in late 2020 after it was discovered that 7,000 votes had been flipped.

Electronic voting equipment and election management software from Dominion and Hart also had known vulnerabilities as shown at conventions like DEFCON 27 in 2019. Minnesota participates in the [Electronic Registration Information Center](https://ericstates.org/)(ERIC), having [joined in 2014](https://www.minnpost.com/political-agenda/2014/09/minnesota-joins-multistate-voter-registration-group/), which shares voter registration and other data between states, ostensibly to maintain clean voter rolls but a service which could be used to artificially inflate them. Were there any anamolies in the statewide voter registration system (SVRS) prior to or after the 2020 election in Minnesota?

In the psychological realm, in mid-2020 George Floyd dominated news cycles. Covid-19 was also a daily discussion topic on and offline. This provided distraction, air cover, and justification for procedural changes which flew in the face of existing Minnesota law. In the runup to 2022 elections, there have also been reports of tampering with the precinct delegate process and possible influence operations to position establishment candidates for the MNGOP endorsement and attempt to seed doubt beneath strong grassroots candidates who want to serve the interests of the people, not clandestine masters.

## Minnesota Statutes and Law

Let's start with just a sample of Minnesota election laws and orders which affected the rules and procedures in the November 2020 general election:

1. Election day registration allowed by [Minnesota Statute 201.061 Subd.3](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/201.061) (legal since 1974, when Minnesota became the second state to allow it)
2. Voter ID not required by law
3. Dropboxes for absentee and mail-in ballots allowed by [Minnesota Statute 203B.082](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/203B.082) (58% of 2020 votes were reportedly absentee/mail-in ballots in Minnesota, over 1.9 million votes and more than 1.2 million *more* than the prior election)
4. LaRose v. Simon - 1) Removed witness requirements for mail voters in Primary - 2) Extended the deadline to accept mail ballots (2 days) - STIPULATION AND PARTIAL CONSENT DECREE - [Read LaRose Order 62 CV 20 3149 Order on July 31 Motions](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7012992-LaRose-Order-62-CV-20-3149-Order-on-July-31.html)
5. NAACP v. Simon - 1) Removed Witness Requirements for mail voters in General, 2) Extended the deadline to accept mail ballots (7 days), 3) MN Supreme Court Scheduled for September 3, 2020 - STIPULATION AND PARTIAL CONSENT DECREE - [Read NAACP Order 62 CV 20 3625 Order on July 31 Motions](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7012991-NAACP-Order-62-CV-20-3625-Order-on-July-31-Motions.html)
6. [This judicial complaint](https://img1.wsimg.com/blobby/go/47803963-5178-4387-9865-0ea08f5332bd/downloads/22%2003%2017%20grewing%20complaint%20with%20exhibits.pdf?ver=1648648812808) argues Judge Sarah Grewing's decision *not* to recuse herself from above cases
7. A Chair of a major political party or the Secretary of State may consult with the software vendor to hire an independent third party to inspect the source code [Minnesota Statute 206.57 Subd.6](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/206.57)

No. 3 and No. 4 were put into motion after the MN Legislature, in April 2020, rejected Secretary of State Steve Simon's request for irrevocable power to alter election law during a pandemic.

No. 7 included because to my knowledge this has not been done but would go a long way toward providing transparency.

## Modern Electronic Election Systems

On January 6, 2017 the Department of Homeland Security [designated elections as critical infrastructure](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2017/01/06/statement-secretary-johnson-designation-election-infrastructure-critical), alongside food, water, and electricity.

About three months before the election, on July 28, 2020, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) identified the following components as lacking security:

* voter registration systems
* epollbooks
* ballot preparation
* voting machines
* tabulation systems
* official websites
* storage facilities

Besides storage facilities, each of these components has undergone digitization in recent years.

Not long after the election, on November 12, 2020, CISA Assistant Director Bob Kolaksy, along with other members of the Election Infrastructure Government Coordinating Council (GCC) Executive Committee, made a joint statement declaring that "The November 3rd election was the most secure in American history... There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised."

![The most secure election, according to who?](joint_statement_CISA.png)

Rick Weible, in a workshop at the Big Lake City Hall on Wednesday May 25, 2022, pointed out that this statement could not have included a review of Minnesota, since Minnesota's Canvassing Board would not certify the election until November 24, 2020 and Minnesota's election would not be certified until early December.

Would it be unreasonable to ask Bob Kolasky how CISA's analysis which produced the Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience Note had changed between late July and mid November?

On June 3, 2022, CISA [issued an advisory](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/advisories/icsa-22-154-01), "Vulnerabilities Affecting Dominion Voting Systems ImageCast X", which focuses on Dominion (but ES&S and Hart also have glaring vulnerabilities) and may have been released to get ahead of the Halderman report. The advisory detailed weaknesses including [hidden functionality](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/912.html) and [improper protection of alternate path](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/424.html). Now, the Halderman report focuses on the internet connectivity of election equipment. But, I tend to agree with Draza Smith that we shouldn't over-focus on that given what she wrote on Telegram in March, 2022: "The thing we need to get everyone to understand is that it is the software the vendors have baked into the machines that is cheating the American people."

It's not that internet connectivity isn't a problem but that it isn't the only vulnerability and even a machine *without* internet connectivity can be a huge problem for fairness and transparency.

Now, let's take the CISA-identified components one at a time.

### The Statewide Voter Registration System (SVRS)

The registration file is critical because it stores the data which helps determine who in the state is eligible to vote.

Inflated rolls facilitate ballot mules and support machine manipulation. It seems plausible that non-profits like the <a href="https://ericstates.org/" target=_new>Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC)</a> provide support to states using inflated rolls through "reports that show voters who have moved within their state, voters who have moved out of state, voters who have died, duplicate registrations in the same state, and individuals who are potentially eligible to vote but are not yet registered."

For instance, if member states like Minnesota do not remove voters who have moved out of state or have died, then the result is an inflated voter roll. Even if the dead or out of state voter votes, that vote technically counts since that individual will be on the statewide voter registration system with a voter ID in the system.

How do we know that voter rolls are inflated, providing an ample supply of ready-to-launch voters?

Voter rolls and histories are public information that you can request from the <a href="https://www.sos.state.mn.us/election-administration-campaigns/data-maps/registered-voter-list-requests/" target=_new>Minnesota Secretary of State's website</a> for $46. Note that your request is made at a particular moment in time. However, if you request a list before and after an election, as people like <a href="https://midwestswampwatch.com" target=_new>Rick Weible</a> did for the November 3rd, 2020 General Election, and you are handy with database management (these are big files) then you can see how the lists changed. If you were to continue to request lists every few weeks, then you could see how the lists change over time, sometimes dramatically. (Going forward, it should not require experts in database management to hold our government accountable.)

It was these voter rolls and histories that allowed Rick Weible to discover that more than 700,000 reported absentee votes were not yet connected to a voter in the SVRS on November 29, 2020, only 25 days after the election and a mere 5 days after the Minnesota State Canvassing Board <a href="https://www.sos.state.mn.us/about-the-office/news-room/state-canvassing-board-certifies-results-of-2020-general-election/" target=_new>certified the results</a> of the 2020 General Election.

When comparing voter rolls with census population data, one can chart turnout of the voting age population. In the following chart, we see that Minnesota ranks 1st in voting age population turnout, an indicator of fraud.

![Minnesota Ranks First in Percent of 18+ Voted](election_participation.jpeg)

### Epollbooks

Epollbooks are generally connected to the internet so that they can both receive a precinct-level extract of the statewide voter registration system or are at minimum a digital file if not connected or networked. The internet connection also provides for real-time updating which conceivably would have allowed our attorney general in Minnesota to make a [certain tweet at 3:57pm](https://twitter.com/keithellison/status/1323746158557253632) on election day.

In 2016, when Rick Weible was the mayor of St. Bonifacius, he first hacked into the proposed epollbook within minutes and then declined to sign a contract to use them in St. Bonifacius. His was the only city in Hennepin County *not* to use epollbooks (they used paper pollbooks) in the following election. Epollbooks are not certified by the Election Assistance Commission (EAC).

As shown on [the Verified Voting website](https://verifiedvoting.org/verifier/#mode/navigate/map/ppEquip/mapType/normal/year/2022/state/27), the majority if not all of Minnesota's counties use the KNOWiNK Poll Pads, which are essentially converted iPads for epollbook use.

### Ballot Preparation

Ballot preparation is a complicated process. But Patrick Colbeck does us a favor of simplifying the complex in his book, *The 2020 Coup*:

"Ballots are another key election infrastructure component with security vulnerabilities. Modern ballots are much more sophisticated than a piece of paper with checkboxes next to names. Today's ballots are sophisticated paper and/or digital documents. In fact, in some cases, ballots are replaced by Direct-Recording Electronic (DRE) voting machines.

"Ballot preparation is a complicated process of overlaying political geographies with the contests and candidates specific to each district and then translating those layouts into unique combinations of ballot data. Ballot preparation data takes multiple forms such as ballot images (both paper and electronic), the data files necessary to build ballot images, audio files for special use ballots, and specific files for export to external systems such as websites for Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA)-focused digital systems. Ballot preparation also generates the data necessary for tabulating votes within a voting machine and aggregating tabulated votes within a jurisdiction or state. This process is usually completed in an election documents and records management system (EDRMS), which is special software designed to manage documents and records throughout the document lifecycle, from creation to destruction. Access to the information in such systems would enable anyone attempting to subert the integrity of an election with the information necessary to create ballots independently of election officials. Of course, ballots are also where voters record their votes. Vote tallies are generated from the information on ballots therefore their integrity is very important to protect."

After watching 2000 Mules Erin Clements asked where the NGOs that printed the ballots for the mules may have gotten the ballot formatting and ballot styles to correctly print ballots. I imagine True the Vote's Catherine Engelbrecht and Gregg Phillips' team were asking the same questions, leading to their follow-on work from the Wisconsin hearing to the Maricopa County senate hearing to the work on the ground in Yuma County.

While Minnesota uses paper ballots in all 87 counties, we are *not* hand-counting them. Because there is no hand tally, we are putting our trust completely in the voting machines and tabulation systems. The voting machines, also called tabulators, scan and count the votes. The tallies from the tabulators are then aggregated in tabulation software known as an election management system.

Another way to view which equipment will be in use for 2022 is on the [Verified Voting website](https://verifiedvoting.org/verifier/#mode/navigate/map/ppEquip/mapType/normal/year/2022/state/27).

Remember, there are known and potential vulnerabilities in all voting machines, but let's zoom in for a moment on the most-used equipment in Minnesota.

DS200s were used in 65 of Minnesota's 87 counties in 2020.

In April 2021, the DS200 used in Antrim, County Michigan was found to have a [4G wireless modem installed](https://letsfixstufforg-my.sharepoint.com/personal/patrick_letsfixstuff_org/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fpatrick%5Fletsfixstuff%5Forg%2FDocuments%2FFiles%2F2020%20Election%2FLegal%2FExhibit%206%20Jim%20Penrose%20Report%2Epdf&parent=%2Fpersonal%2Fpatrick%5Fletsfixstuff%5Forg%2FDocuments%2FFiles%2F2020%20Election%2FLegal&ga=1) within the enclosure of the machine.

![Telit LE910-SV1 found within ES&S enclosure](telit.png)

Furthermore, [the exhibit describes](https://letsfixstufforg-my.sharepoint.com/personal/patrick_letsfixstuff_org/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fpatrick%5Fletsfixstuff%5Forg%2FDocuments%2FFiles%2F2020%20Election%2FLegal%2FExhibit%206%20Jim%20Penrose%20Report%2Epdf&parent=%2Fpersonal%2Fpatrick%5Fletsfixstuff%5Forg%2FDocuments%2FFiles%2F2020%20Election%2FLegal&ga=1) how the card was "utilizing a commercial Verizon SIM card with an APN configuration specific to the ES&S DS200 provisioning. Testing revealed that the same SIM card could be utilized in a separate wireless hotspot device and the device could then join the same APN as the ES&S voting machines. An unauthorized user could gain access to this APN by an extra SIM card pre-provisioned for this APN, or by removing a SIM from an operational device and using it in another device."

To repeat: This wireless modem was found on an enclosed part of the machine. Therefore if these same or similar wireless modems were also installed on the DS200s throughout Minnesota, it would be invisible to election judges, poll challengers, and even election officials.

I include this information in the preparation phase of our discussion because this 4G wireless modem implementation would likely need to be installed *before* or *during* the election in order to be used by bad actors.

Additionally, scientist Dr. Douglas Frank [has called the ES&S DS200](https://t.me/FollowTheData/1985) "one of the most hackable ballot scanners in the country". Because the code is not open source, it is difficult to know all the vulnerabilities that may exist. And since its "System and Method for Decoding Marks on a Paper Ballot" is proprietary, patent law means ES&S owns that intellectual property. That being said, former cyber analyst for the Air Force Jake Stauffer's [vulnerability report](https://www.scribd.com/document/513400991/ESS-RedTeam-Jake-Stauffer-Vulnerability-Security-Assessment-Report) is revealing, demonstrating among other details that "file systems are not encrypted [which] allowed the team to recover system configuration information, password hashes, and ES&S specific binaries."

To repeat: the ES&S DS200 was in use in 65 Minnesota counties in 2020.

To make matters worse, however, there are apparently settings which allow the ballot images to not be saved (reducing the audit trail) and potentially settings which turn off the Cast Vote Record (CVR) report functionality.

This is a big problem because it turns off the machines' ability to tell on itself. Where this decision was made, it may have prevented voters from learning whether the machine-recorded vote tallies matched their paper ballot submissions. (The outputs of CVR reports will be used in the backup attack phase and defense phase chapters.)

Turning off the functionality to generate CVRs would also explain why Minnesotans sending public data requests have been met with letters like this one from the Todd County Attorney.

![The opinion of the Todd County Attorney](todd_county_atty_opinion.png)

*Please note that although we have focused on ES&S, there are several Minnesota counties that use Dominion systems and several that use Hart systems. Neither are safe or secure from cyber threats nor is their source code available to be examined with the notable exception of the Dominion Voting Systems (DVS) Election Management System (EMS) server from Mesa County, Colorado, which is the focus of the [Mesa County Report #3](https://magaraccoon.com/docs/MesaCountyReport3.pdf) and featured in the [Selection Code](https://selectioncode.com) documenatary.

## Tabulation Systems

Here I lean on Patrick Colbeck's description once again:

"Tabulators are critical election infrastructure components with significant security vulnerabilities. At the precinct-level, tabulators are used to read a ballot, convert the ballot image to votes, and add the vote data on a given ballot to the running tally of votes stored in a digital table. Precint-level vote tallies are then aggregated by centralized vote tabulation systems at the municipal, county, and state levels. Collectively, these systems help determine and communicate the results of an election. If tabulators are compromised, they can shift votes from one candidate to another. THese votes shifts can change the results of an election."

In the [3/15/2022 Nye County, Nevada County Commissioner’s meeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=234&v=GBKz1o_VqAE&feature=youtu.be) cyber security consultant Mark Cook [described his experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKz1o_VqAE&t=234s) with computers pre-internet in the CompuServe and Prodigy days, then as a consultant to protect companies from threats and seal off vulnerability, and finally with election systems.

Today, Dominion is a popular voting system which uses Microsoft SQL database, one which Mark was and is very familiar with as he used SQL databases from day 1. In the [same meeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=234&v=GBKz1o_VqAE&feature=youtu.be), he discussed how within the first minute of getting his hands on a Dominion system, he was able to access the backend and change votes...without leaving a trace.

In 2021, when Tina Peters learned that a Dominion vendor was planning to visit her office to make a software update, she took action in line with her statutory duties to preserve election data as the Mesa County Clerk. She worked with consultants to save a copy of the before and after image of her Dominion Voting Systems (DVS) Election Management System (EMS) servers, which data analysts then began investigating to detect what Dominion's "Trusted Build" may have changed.

It turned out to be a lot.

The [Mesa County Colorado Voting Systems Report #3: Election Database and Data Process Analysis](https://magaraccoon.com/docs/MesaCountyReport3.pdf) proves database manipulation happened inside the Colorado Dominion Voting Systems (DVS) Election Management System (EMS). Not once, but twice, in both the 2020 General Election and the 2021 Grand Junction Municipal Election.

That report has been called the "Rosetta Stone" because it provided the fingerprints of the nefarious activity.

These not so trust-worthy software updates were performed by Dominion employees across the country, possibly destroying evidence of election tampering and manipulation. It is possible that such an update may have occurred in the six Minnesota counties using the Domininon Voting System (DVS) Election Management System (EMS). So far, just the one before/after image of the servers exists, truly a God send.

## Influence Operations

I have chosen to borrow this term from Patrick Colbeck since it is less frequently used when compared to *psychological operations* or *psyops*. The screens which bring us our daily inspiration and fear, information from loved ones and our 2-minute's hate (à la *1984*), are seemingly a blessing and a curse.

A blessing because it is only with the internet that information can be shared quickly enough and widely enough to outflank centralized media platforms and censorship regimes.

But a curse because influence operations are deployed on those screens which provide an unobstructed path to our brain.

For me, the most significant influence operations in the preparation phase in Minnesota were George Floyd, its extended aftermath, and of course, Covid-19.

At the time I lived not far from 38th and Chicago.

A few months later, I biked there once and another time walked there. Roads were blocked making it difficult for locals to even leave their streets. Shops were closed replaced by vendors selling t-shirts and BLM masks. Flowers were laid before the provocative murals and around the monument at the intersection.

In the days following the incident, there were protests and looting and riots. The 3rd precinct police station burned. It was a trying time to the point that I even asked one of my clients if I could take time off from a gig. One protest organized by Royce White went to the Federal Reserve, an interesting choice that got the attention of many, though I missed it at the time.

Covid-19 led to lockdowns worldwide. The monthly discussion groups I'd held ended and I resorted for a time to arguing needlessly with friends online. Then came the experimental vaccines, only qualifying to be called as such because of dictionaries redefining the term. Perhaps suspecting I had exercised my right not to partake, a Mayo Clinic ICU doctor before a pickup soccer game asked if I had questions about Covid-19. Months later, I was on the phone with the head of a hospital in Seattle who declared that the inventors of the mRNA vaccines would get Nobel prizes. Maybe so. But so did Barrack Hussein Obama (*before* many realized what he was up to). When I asked him if he got his booster, he said he probably wouldn't get the next one.

The chaos played into the enemy's hands.

The subversion of our elections was well under way.

All the while, preparations continued to be made for the election with little if any reporting of substance regarding the consent decrees which stripped witness and signature requirements from absentee ballots, nor the mass installment of Zuckerboxes, nor the preparations the work of True the Vote has shone light upon in the first half of 2022.

Fortunately, there are signs around the country that people are becoming aware of the fundamental issue (that these machines are designed to allow manipulation) and using their voice to affect change how their county conducts elections. Yesterday, April 19, 2022, men and women spoke in Crow Wing, Dakota, and Sherburne counties ([video from Sherburne](https://erikvanmechelen.substack.com/p/open-forum-speakers-address-removing)). Recently, two counties in Nevada, Nye and Esmeralda have already decided not to use electronic voting equipment in upcoming elections. Which county commissioners will be the first in Minnesota to do the same and restore the voice that is constitutionally inherent in the right to vote to their constituents?

## Election Process, Rules, and Procedues

DATE - MN Legislature Rejected SOS Steve Simon’s Request for Irrovacable Power to Alter Election Law During a Pandemic. (This fact differentiates MN from other states.)

LaRose v. Simon filed - Democrat activists’ groups filed suits against Democrat MN SOS demanding the changes to the law he had sought. Ignoring the MN Constitution and Separation of Power issues, MN SOS Simon, represented by Democrat AG Ellison, entered into consent decrees with their supporters to obliterate long-standing election law. The MNGOP via its attorney failed to intervene in a timely manner. The consent decree was approved by the court prior to the first hearing on the matter. (These overly broad consent decrees later approved by judges.) - SUITS FILED

NAACP v. Simon filed

LaRose v. Simon - 1) Removed witness requirements for mail voters in Primary - 2) Extended the deadline to accept mail ballots (2 days) - STIPULATION AND PARTIAL CONSENT DECREE

NAACP v. Simon - 1) Removed Witness Requirements for mail voters in General, 2) Extended the deadline to accept mail ballots (7 days), 3) MN Supreme Court Scheduled for September 3, 2020 - STIPULATION AND PARTIAL CONSENT DECREE

## Preparation for 2022 in Minnesota

It matters a lot which candidates are on the ballot for a primary or general election. Imagine if Jeb Bush or Ted Cruz had faced off against Hillary Clinton, instead of Donald Trump. In that event, some percentage of republican voters may have stayed home. Unexciting candidates have that effect. If voters stay home a vote can be cast in their stead.

The method of putting forward unexciting candidates is also effective in state and local elections. As the media tries to get us talking about a red wave, we must stay vigilant and put forward America First candidates. It does no one any good to elect candidates who can be bought by the highest bidder or be influenced away from the principles of upholding the constitution.

QUOTED FROM OPENING OF THIS CHAPTER
In the psychological realm, in mid-2020, George Floyd dominated news cycles. Covid-19 was also a daily discussion topic on and offline. This provided distraction, air cover, and justification for procedural changes which flew in the face of existing Minnesota law.

Just as there were distractions in 2020, in the runup to the 2022 midterm elections, there has been no shortage of diversions attempted by those who wish to keep us from reclaiming our government.

This Rasmussen survey shows what voters care about versus what the media cares about:

![61% Very Concerned About Election Integrity](ras_survey.png)

Back in February, the beginning of the election process started in Minnesota at the precinct caucuses.

There, the key item of business is electing delegates. Those chosen in their precincts will then serve as delegates at the basic political organizing unit (BPOU) level. From there, another round of voting happens to elect delegates to the congressional district and state conventions, where endorsements occur for governor, attorney general, state auditor, and secretary of state.

Right from the jump, there were issues at the precinct caucuses.

As precinct caucuses ca

all this amounts to...

there have also been reports of tampering with the precinct delegate process and possible influence operations to position establishment candidates for the MNGOP endorsement.

We'll see, primaries are tbh the big thing and there are already issues there and in republican leadership conferences

ALL OF THIS EQUIVALENT TO INFLATING VOTER ROLLS (WITH ILLEGITIMATE VOTERS)
ALL OF THIS IS EQUIVALENT TO STUFFING BALLOT BOX

If this can happen in Otter Tail County, it can happen in any county in Minnesota. This was why some were calling for a full and transparent audit of all county delegate lists to compare with state lists prior to further BPOU and endorsing conventions. These audits did not satisfyingly occur.

I asked my BPOU Chair for an audit and the request was declined.

In Morrison County,
listen to Nathan Wesenberg's reporting

ALL OF THIS EQUIVALENT TO INFLATING VOTER ROLLS (WITH ILLEGITIMATE VOTERS)
ALL OF THIS IS EQUIVALENT TO STUFFING BALLOT BOX

EVEN A 15% TAMPERING WOULD HAVE A 30% EFFECT SIZE - JUST LIKE VOTE SWAPPING IN AN ELECTION, IF I TAKE A TRUMP VOTE AND SWAP TO BIDE, -1 TO TRUMP, +1 TO BIDEN, OR NET +2

IF YOU WERE TAMPERING WITH LISTS, YOU WERE PUTTING PEOPLE ON LIST WHO YOU **KNEW** WOULD VOTE YOUR DIRECTION, CHOOSING THE DELEGATE INSTEAD OF LETTING THEM BE VOTED UPON AS IN THE RULES AND MNGOP CONSTITUTION AND BPOU RULES, ETC.

senate district 10 endorsement convention cancelled

edwin hahn barred from senate 4 endorsement convention and participation in state convention as a delegate

who knows how many more this may have occurred to if people had spoken up about what they were seeing

erik van mechelen not allowed to participate in state convention endorsement process for secretary of state (link to video/article)
https://erikvanmechelen.substack.com/p/proposed-rule-29-to-prevent-new-sos

governor's asked to write on a sign, one word, jerk, loser, problem, take photo to persaude them to accept endorsement

according to the electronic devices at the convention, about 55% were new people, but how many *more* people should there have been without tampering? there was no transparent audit done of the statewide delegate lists which should have been done to ensure no one was left out of the process

letter from chairman david haan, calls anyone asking for paper ballots, SABOTEURS
any campaign can ask and get the next day.

at convention, another speech meant to dissuade people from standing for paper ballots - it will take too long, etc.

i asked the yellow shirted guy how things were going, who i could ask questions to about process, he pointed to the people on the stage... the mngop leadership.

then we use electronic devices, don't show many of the results.

in sos race i asked kim and kelly, neither was able to share what the result of the 2nd round was, so i'm left wondering whether kim even reached the 60% threshold. i asked eric lucero if it was normal not to show the final results, and he said it was

that may be 'how things are done' but at least in the general election we were told that Biden received 81 million votes and didn't have to take someone's word for it that he beat Trump handily.

Shah's campaign asked for audits, no answer from the party.

all this is part of election process

who wins primary becomes the party candidate, and republican candidate or democrat candidate usually win, since most voters have been funneled (through decades of influence operations) into supporting the candidate that their party puts forward.

in the recent past, as the Democrat party has moved further to the left ideologically, part of the uniparty strategy seems to be to endorse and run Republican candidates that are fairly weak and unexciting, like for example 'Low Energy Jeb'. This way, low propensity republican voters will stay home in greater numbers opening the door to the Attack Phase where mail-in ballots are submitted for them.

(Low-Energy Jeb...so low energy that I once contributed to a USA Today article... and Governor Terry McAuliffe, recently defeated by now Governor Glenn Youngkin, supposedly a win for Republicans, but in my opinion Youngkin is likely a Republican in disguise and a suitable poster child for the false assertion that in machine-driven elections the algorithms can be easily overwhelmed)

Knowing what I know now, I wouldn't do work for them again.

the endorsement is used as a marketing badge to signal

but in this environment, if a candidate could only have one, would they rather have the endorsement of their party or an endorsement from President Trump? (but also, lets not read too much into every Trump endorsement)

having seen how the party puts forward candidates, i am embarrassed. embarrassed that i previously mindlessly just voted for the candidates and was not involved in helping to choose them

also, open Primary, in Georgia, about 7% of voters in the republican primary were democrats

    Minnesota has nonpartisan registration. There is no option to affiliate with a political party on the voter registration form.

## Endorsements

this could also happen in the minnesota primary on august 9 for select races

I think I understand your frustration with Wardlow apparently going back on his word.

In my opinion Wardlow should not have agreed to honor the endorsement: However if he had said that, likely that admission would have been used against him as well.

How *should* he have played it?

Maybe he could have learned from how Trump answered when asked in his debate vs. Biden.

Trump said if the election is fair, I’ll accept it, but if there’s fraud, I won’t.

Instead of giving a Yes/No answer which can be used against him.

Jesus, when asked if taxes should be paid to Ceasar:

Give unto Ceasar what is Ceaser’s, give unto God what is God’s.

Neil Shah asked for audits of the Rochester state convention results, which David Haan explicitly said would be available to any campaign after the convention. No response from MNGOP.

I don’t have a good feeling at all about how MNGOP ran state convention.

Am writing a bit about this in the short free book that will be ready in coming weeks.
