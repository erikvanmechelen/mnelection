# Election Night

Some of ch 3 will come here 




Summary tape signing - or refusing (ministerial chain from summary tapes to county certifications to state-level certifications) 

Additional amendments are in the works for 2024.
For instance, added to MS 204C.20 BALLOTS; NUMBER TO BE COUNTED. will be a subdivision which reads: Subd. 5. Precincts with ballot tabulators. In precincts using ballot tabulators, once the final count of ballots agrees with the number of ballots to be counted, election judges must immediately prepare the summary statement in accordance with section 204C.24 and seal the ballots in accordance with section 204C.25 for return to the county auditor. The effective date will be June 1, 2024. Click here to see HF4772.
This new subdivision would seem to be aimed at preventing a parallel hand count on election day after the ballots have gone through the electronic tabulator.

	•	Overlay absentee vs precinct timelines 
	•	Add “what cannot legally happen yet” at each step 
Just say what format you want next.
