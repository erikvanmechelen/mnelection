*"Are you ready?"*

*"Yes."*

—From a conversation between Mark Cook and the author at the close of Day 3 of Mike Lindell's Cyber Symposium

***

In the early 1900s it took Bertrand Russell over 300 pages to prove that 1 + 1 = 2. Thankfully with the work being done around the country since November 3rd, 2020 (and long before), it has not take nearly as long here to unpack the state of our rigged election system and how to fix it.

We the People have lost confidence in our elections process. This has been in the water a long time and has only intensified as evidence mounts in all 50 states. We don't trust the machines which slice and dice our votes nor the backdoors into election management systems; we don't like insecure mass mail-in absentee ballots and drop boxes exploited by vote trafficking organizations; we have lost faith in internet-connected poll books and inflated voter rolls obscured from public view.

Here in Minnesota, roadblocks were put in our path when we wanted proper audits of the ballots and the machines or simply to have a look at the cast vote record (CVR) reports which are automatically generated once ballots are scanned (these allow the machines to tell on themselves). These obstructions lit a greater fire under us to discover the truth and share it with anyone who has humble heart and a desire to learn.

We are aiming for a future voting process where the end results are provable as per the votes cast representing the will of the people.

The sheer amount of data and evidence available to date does not change the fact that machines are still counting our votes. Nor the fact that epollbooks, drop boxes, mail-in ballots, absentee ballots, early voting, and other vulnerabilities are still in play.

We can change this. And we will.

## The County Commission Strategy

County commissioners have concurrent jurisdiction to govern the overall conduct of elections. Ultimately they must decide whether to use electronic voting equipment to begin with and, if they do, whether to certify local elections run on insecure hardware and software. For the time being, only hand counting paper ballots minimizes fraud to the fullest extent.

We do not presently have fairness nor transparency but day by day we have the chance to regain it and set things right. Elections should be on one day where paper ballots are hand counted, very achievable if polling places are organized into small, manageable precincts. 22 out of 87 Minnesota counties had fewer than 5,700 votes in 2020 and could perhaps more swiftly move to hand tallying, which is already acceptable by law.

[Minnesota Statute 204C.04 EMPLOYEES; TIME OFF TO VOTE](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/204C/full) in subdivision 1 already provides the the **Right to be Absent** in order to "appear at the employee's polling place, cast a ballot, and return to work on the day of that election, without penalty or deduction from salary or wages because of the absence."

Going forward, if additional man power is needed to hand count paper ballots in precinct polling places on election day, [204B.195 TIME OFF FROM WORK TO SERVE AS ELECTION JUDGE](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/204B.195) allows for absence without penalty.

I have met many people who have said they would count the votes for no compensation just so that everyone can regain confidence that the election was conducted fairly and transparently in their precinct and county.

BELOW PULLED FROM PREPARATION

Moving on to other ES&S equipment: In 2020, some counties began upgrading to DS450s and DS850s.

![DS450 Pricing Quote Sent to ](ds450_pricing_mcleod.png)

While county commissioners in other states have described these machines as being built in Omaha, Nebraska, both the DS450 and DS850 are made in Germany.

![Assembled in Germany](assembled_in_germany.png)

These newer models are quite expensive.

![Purchase Proposal Quote for McLeod County in 2020](MCCC_DS450_purchase_proposal_quote.png)

Even the Site Support at $4,250 *alone* could be repurposed toward 20 election judges at $20 an hour for 10 hours. Many more election judges could be hired with the $50,000 spent on the DS450 tabulator.

Meanwhile, Saint Louis County recently purchased [the DS950](https://www.essvote.com/products/ds950/), one of the newest electronic voting machines on the market, likely costing about $250,000.

It's one thing to spend a lot of tax-payer money on vulnerable machines, but another to actually use them correctly. The [DS200 Operator Guide](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9tgjadp53l7e34o/ES%26S%20DS%20200%20Operator%20Guide.pdf?dl=0) is 222 pages long.

The following two emails between staff at ES&S and the County Elections Administrator in McLeod County demonstrate that there is much vendor hand-holding to maintain and operate these machines.

![](absentee_mcleod_county_1of2.png)

![](absentee_mcleod_county_2of2.png)

Are we asking too much of our election officials at the county level to not only maintain and operate but also mitigate cyber threats to these machines?



<h2>Available Remedies</h2>
<p>
	Speaking of remedies... In other states like Nevada, county commissioners are already <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKz1o_VqAE" target=_new> making decisions</a> to remove electronic voting equipment from upcoming elections and making plans to return to counterfeit-proof paper ballots hand-counted in precinct on a single election day, greatly simplifying the process. Minnesotans have attended their county commissioner meetings and <a href="https://erikvanmechelen.substack.com/p/open-forum-speakers-address-removing" target=_new>have spoken</a> toward those same ends—that trend is likely to continue.
</p><p>
	Counties that move to a machine-free alternative will gain confidence in the election process and results and set a positive example for counties that follow. Meanwhile, our legislators can at any time draft election legislation to remove electronic voting equipment. Or maybe a lawsuit similar to the one filed in Arizona on April 22, 2022—which seeks to ban ballot-counting machines—could succeed in Minnesota.
</p>
<h2>The Role of Secretary of State</h2>
<p>
	What happened in 2020 (and in the preceding decades) should never be allowed to happen again. As Minnesota's next secretary of state, I will make sure of that.
</p><p>
	<strong>Going forward, your voice and vote will count, perhaps for the first time in your life.</strong>
</p><p>
	Among the Minnesota secretary of state's responsibilities are chairing the State Canvassing Board, convening Minnesota's electoral college, and serving on the Executive Council and Board of Investment. But perhaps the most important responsibility is <strong>the administration of Minnesota election law</strong>, including strict adherence to critical statutes such as <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/206.57" target=_new>206.57 EXAMINATION OF NEW VOTING SYSTEMS</a> and <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/203B.121" target=_new>203B.121 BALLOT BOARDS</a> and <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/204B.44" target=_new>204B.44 ERRORS AND OMISSIONS; REMEDY</a>.
</p><p>
	I will get to know county auditors and city and township officials to carry out free, fair, and 100% auditable elections (not the risk-limiting audits currently used, but <em>full and complete</em> including audits of ballots, machines, and databases). If any county commissioners send me <a href="https://erikvanmechelen.substack.com/p/motion-passed-to-request-minnesota" target=_new>a resolution in favor of an audit in their county</a>, as happened in Crow Wing County in January 2022, I will do the right thing. If counties <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/206.58" target=_new>opt out of electronic voting machines</a> (e-poll books, tabulators, and election management systems), I will connect them to experts capable of setting up counterfeit-proof paper ballots which can be hand-counted in precinct on election day and immediately audited by anyone casting a vote. I will take advice from local experts on major amendments to the statewide voter registration system (SVRS) and make it transparently available to the public to reduce or eliminate ready-to-launch voters.
</p><p>
	Even though counties are responsible for elections in their county, the Minnesota Secretary of State should be a standard of integrity and continuously work to establish true confidence in the process.
</p><p>
	This past year, I've worked with and learned from local and national grassroots leaders including some of the very best in the fields of cyber security, networks, law, and information warfare, to be well equipped for the road ahead.
</p><p>
	This all being said, the failed and corrupt political establishment's time is up. Days are numbered for rigged machine systems that install uni-party Democrats and uni-party Republicans. It would be an honor to serve you in public office alongside many other grassroots servant leaders who have already stood up and stepped onto a path to truly get results in Minnesota.
</p>

<h2>What can you do?</h2>
<p>
	Perhaps most important is that you stay as informed as you can while continuing to ask questions. The powers that be don't like when we <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/gb7dgx2v9t5du25/ES%26S_FOIA_Request_CVR.pdf?dl=0" target=_new>submit FOIA or public data requests for CVRs</a>, show up at county commissioner meetings to share evidence, or otherwise use our first amendment rights, but if we don't hold those in public office accountable, who will? We are the people we've been waiting for. Put on the full armor of God.
<strong>
	Join me in reclaiming the government for We the People.
</strong>
</p><p>
	If you do decide to vote for me and we are still relying on electronic voting machines for the Primary (August 9th) and the General Election (November 8th), please cast your vote in-person at your precinct on election day. If enough of you do this, there could be a chance to overwhelm the algorithms.
	</p><p>
	If possible I would have run for office with no party affiliation, especially after learning about evidence of <a href="https://saveminnesota.org/" target=_new>election tampering</a> in the MNGOP precinct caucuses, in my opinion remaining unaddressed and unresolved. The secretary of state's responsibilities should obviously be non-partisan. However, since it is not possible when running for secretary of state in Minnesota to have no party affiliation, I will run as a republican.
	</p>

<h2>What Led Me Here</h2>
<p>
	This is my seventeenth year living in Minnesota, although my family returned to Stevens County each year in my youth from Texas, Gabon, Louisiana, Indonesia, and China, where my dad's work as a geophysicist brought us. In 5th grade and 7th grade (as secretary) I served in the student council, and was later named or voted captain of several sports teams, including my college soccer team which went to the NCAA tournament. After college, I worked four years in the inventory and software divisions at Target in Minneapolis before investing in myself as a freelance writer for the past eight years. I've assisted governors with a USA Today article and a military veteran with his autobiography, cowrote several books, one a Wall Street Journal bestseller, and helped about 90 authors choose the title of their book.
</p><p>
	With a growing understanding of what happened on November 3rd, 2020, life took a turn. After working with grassroots Minnesotans seeking audits, I attended Mike Lindell's Cyber Symposium in Sioux Falls, South Dakota in August 2021. There I met people like Draza Smith, Seth Keshel, Mark Cook, and Col. Phil Waldron and also learned from people like Col. Shawn Smith, Patrick Colbeck, Joe Oltmann, and Professor David Clements. Here in Minnesota, I've continued to absorb much from people like Rick Weible and Susan Smith, as well as from those attending county commissioners meetings in Crow Wing, Dakota, and Sherburne County. Several dozen more men and women could be listed to whom I am grateful.
</p><p>
	These experiences and relationships were vital in preparing me to not only make the decision to run for Minnesota Secretary of State, but also to become the servant leader necessary to resolve our election problems, preserve election integrity, and restore confidence to all Minnesota voters that their <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/constitution/" target=_new>constitutional right to vote</a> (and to not be disenfranchised of that right) is fully protected.
</p><p>
	Outside of learning about elections, I enjoy running, gardening, and playing the piano.
</p><p>
	Hebrews 12:1 (KJV) reads "Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us."

Getting involved

2021. Spring turned to summer. Despite moments of hope and optimism I continued to experience inner turmoil that even daily tending to the vegetable garden could not quell. There’s a scene in The Matrix before Neo meets Morpheus who offers him the red pill. They’ve stopped the car because Neo doesn’t like the gun being put to his head (a tracking device was implanted by Agent Smith in the prior scene, which Trinity wants to remove). When Neo opens the car door, Trinity asks Neo if he really wants to get out into the pouring rain. While he gazes down a shadowy alley, she reminds him that he knows where that road leads because he’s been there before. Eventually I realized that to get to the future I wanted I couldn’t sit back while others selflessly put themselves in harms way. I too had to do something, even if I didn’t know exactly what that would be.

Early June I applied for Project Veritas but didn't hear back after the second round questionnaire.

Shortly thereafter, in late June, I found a Telegram group seeking audits. The bulk of our activity was to write emails and letters to elected officials who mostly ignored us. This group (at the higher levels) turned out to be controlled opposition and I left after just 45 days not long after returning from the Cyber Symposium. But it was the beginning of more focused research and study of the Minnesota 2020 election and relationships formed there are with to this day.

Another Telegram group was formed around that time, which I joined despite words of caution from some. This one included a strategy room where about 60 people across the country still share information. Early on, around September 2021, I remember video calls where Jeffrey O'Donnell and Dan Sundin shared preliminary findings from the before and after server images revealed by Tina Peters on Days 1 and 2 of Lindell's Cyber Symposium. To this day I encounter folks who were disappointed by the event in Sioux Falls: I may share their confusion regarding the PCAPs but I will not hesitate to point them to Jeffrey O'Donnell's [Mesa Report #3](https://magaraccoon.com/docs/MesaCountyReport3.pdf), which showed "unauthorized creation of new election databases during early voting in the 2020 General Election on October 21, 2020, followed by the digital reloading of 20,346 ballot records into the new election databases, making the original voter intent recorded from the ballots unknown." Furthermore, "5,567 ballots in 58 batches did not have their digital records copied to the new database, although the votes from the ballots in those
batches were recorded in the Main election database."

This was only the first of seven major findings and implications. For any states using Dominion Voting Systems (DVS) Election Management System (EMS), this should be concerning. An audit of the machines would demonstrate that this did not occur in the six counties in Minnesota also using Dominion systems. Until that happens, how can voters be confident something like this didn't happen in Minnesota?

That particular strategy group has gave me the pulse of what those who'd been working since November 3rd, 2020 and before were thinking about and actively doing.

By late summer and autumn, I was trying to help Andrei, inventor of Project Apario, get traction with his new proof of concept while writing several client nonfiction books and continuing to cover election activities in Minnesota.

On October 13th, 2021, I finally attended one of Rick Weible's presentations. I had a newly purchased video camera with me, and Teri, who sets up and promotes many of Rick's events, said I could record the presentation as someone else was a no show. That night I met a few others who had been following Rick's work for some time. One of the older men said it would soon be time for the young people like me to step up.

I went on to record a few more of Rick's presentations and appearances before county commissions throughout the state.

His work with [Midwest Swamp Watch](https://midwestswampwatch.com) began with a focus on what happened in 2020, but in late 2021 shifted focus to support grassroots efforts to improve their local county elections. This change led to many people standing up and taking action throughout Minnesota, an effort which in mid-2022 includes a dozen counties but affects many more.

The emphasis today is on local control, accountability, and oversight. In a strict reading of restrictive Minnesota statutes, we are entering territory where county commissions and election officials will have the choice to either follow the law or decline to certify their county's elections with the awareness they were conducted on machines and software wide open to attack.

In February 2022 I attended my first precinct caucus. There alongside others I became a delegate to my BPOU, and at the BPOU level became a delegate to the state convention. Between February and May I learned a lot about the inner workings of the Minnesota Republican Party, also referred to as the MNGOP.

the Primary is August 9. many republicans to choose from for congress, state senate, state house, and (constitutional roles, sos, governor)

based on Georgia's primary (but not only Georgia's), there are likely to be eyebrow-raising *reported* results. don't lose heart. vote with your conscience, keep asking questions, and continue raising awareness to everyone you meet. wherever we are going as Americans and as a worldwide free people, we are going together. don't trip one another. help each other. love your neighbor. forgive other's mistakes as they forgive yours. together we end tyranny and have a chance to become free again.
