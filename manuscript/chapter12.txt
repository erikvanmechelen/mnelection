# Afterward

As I wrap up the writing on the paperback version in late June, 2022, we are entering a new phase.

Weapons of mass deception are failing and people are waking up to the truth. A truth for which they have long hungered.

It is said once one has seen, he cannot unsee.

That was how it was for me, with the election evidence.

But also, the grammer of "once one has seen, he cannot unsee" holds for seeking the truth: once one has tasted the truth, experienced it, then it can no longer be unknown. It can no longer be cast out of one's being.

Yes, we all may be flawed humans, carrying along our tragedies and misteps. Some of us were long lost, then found.

I follow Jesus and no one else, though I do not pretend to fully comprehend what I mean when I say that. It is just the best way so far of describing how I now live my life.

I feel deep within that there is so much yet to learn. About where I come from. About what we are doing here. About what we are capable of.

As that learning goes on, I will patiently and persistently run the race before me.
