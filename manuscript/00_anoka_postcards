multi-level marketing

entry level, product

some organizations - getting on agenda, giving speech, and handing out all the cards

cap on this

-front end, marketing and educating about issues about elections, positively you can support that the county can actually do
-people we are educating are the people we want to come back to count the votes (marketing for hand counters)
-anoka shopper advertisers

"vote, then come back to count your vote" 

hands on, physical, tangible
positive actions 

gets people engaged 

if people aren't doing something, they are complaining

don't be at home complaining

doing something constructive 






basic message

universally agreeable idea

one speech - 1 speech - consistent 

basic simple, more effective (vs taking time for technical) 

positive thing, people already know 60-70%

version number :) 



for project minnesota

generic value, like a postcard

can adapt to their situation and use 

focus and communicate 

collectibles? 

find the smaller counties with fewer decision makers

generic approach

consider this as a methodology

1. identify decision makers
2. they become point of communication
3. find allies in county, BPOUs and other groups

setup a marketing system for our message 

bulk mailing (need permit) vs postcard (personal)

our product is specialized, relatively few people, needs personal and high impact (to next level of consumer, a problem but don't know what to do about it)

63c, target audience, we don't want people to buy once, remain in system to be the vote counters of the future! 

permanent relationship we're trying to create

cultural shift

allow govt to outsource

we're going to do it ourselves like we used to!
