# How to Get the Attention of County Commissioners

The first county commissioner meeting I attended was in Dakota County in the Spring of 2022. I'd heard that Rick Weible and others would be speaking... (about... check SeaGate storage)

He was talking about... (server not updated? possibly...)

Heidi and others...

See how local govt works (also city councils and townships, dif kinds of organization)

Commissioner meetings. 

Consistent. Because they can make changes. Without waiting for state level legislation. 

Elections should be owned by the people. 

Lowest level of govt to oversee, run, monitor, manage. 

Citizen oversight key. 

1. Go to commissioner meeting 
2. Speak at commissioner meeting 
3. Continue speaking every 2 weeks and teach others 

This is not hard or difficult although you may be nervous at first because it is new. That is good. You will overcome the nerves quickly by remembering why you are doing this. 

Even in the future where we have representatives who are very attentive to the people (who elected them), there will need to be healthy conversations. So why not start practicing now? 

Also, without demand there will be no change to election process and procedures. 

I overspent for my econ degree but supply and demand are a thing. 

If 45 or more counties (out of 87 in Minnesota) have consistent engagement at commissioner meetings, city council meetings, and township supervisor meetings, it will send a message. 

It also reduces plausible deniability. No official should have the excuse, "I wasn't aware," because you didn't show up to help them learn and to proclaim what is going to happen.
