I visited Taiwan in year 2003/4?

Friend says if Taiwanese don't like results, blame USA :) 

Taiwan exclusively uses hand-marked paper ballots that are counted manually at polling stations. This process is a deliberate choice to ensure transparency and security, particularly against potential foreign interference.  

The key features of Taiwan’s election process include: 
In-Person Voting:
There is no absentee, early, proxy, or electronic voting. All eligible citizens must cast their ballot in person on Election Day at their registered polling station. 
Public Hand Count:
Immediately after polls close, each polling station is rearranged for vote counting. Polling staff read out each vote aloud and display the ballot to the public and press who are encouraged to observe the process. 
Transparency and Trust:
The manual, public counting method is widely praised by international observers for its high level of transparency, making it very difficult to manipulate the results. In Taiwan, an average of approximately 1,100 voters are registered per polling station, meaning election workers typically count the ballots of several hundred people at each location. 

Based on data from the 2024 general election: 
—There were approximately 19.5 million eligible voters. 
—A total of 17,795 polling stations were set up nationwide. 
—Turnout is often high, at around 75% in recent elections, meaning a significant majority of registered voters cast their ballots.

Each voter typically casts multiple ballots simultaneously (e.g., one for president, and two for legislators), so the total number of physical ballots counted is even higher per station. The manual counting process, open to public observation, usually takes a few hours, with most results known by 8 p.m. on Election Day. 

Voters in Taiwan do not have to actively register to vote. Taiwan has a comprehensive household registration system (similar to a national population registry). The government’s Household Registration Offices automatically compile the voter lists for elections based on this system. Here are the key points: 
* Automatic Registration: If you are an eligible citizen (meeting age and residency requirements) with household registration in Taiwan, you are automatically registered to vote at your registered address. 
* The Exception: The only major exception is for citizens residing overseas who wish to vote in the Presidential and Vice Presidential election. These voters must submit an application to return and vote. 
* Residency Requirement: To vote in legislative and local elections, a citizen must have been residing in the associated electoral district for at least four consecutive months.
So, for most residents, the system is automatic, eliminating the need for a separate voter registration process.

On election day, voters must bring three specific items to their designated polling station:
1. Their National Identity Card 
This is the primary form of identification. It confirms the voter’s identity and their eligibility based on the automatic household registration.
2. Their Voter Notification Form
This is a notice sent by the election commission that confirms the voter’s polling station, which is based on their registered address.
3. Their Personal Chop (Seal)
This is the most unique requirement. A “chop” is a personal stamp with the voter’s name carved into it.

It is used: 
* To sign or stamp the official ledger when picking up the ballots (acting as a personal signature). 
* Important Note: While the voter brings their personal chop to pick up the ballots, they do not use their personal chop to mark the ballot itself. Instead, the polling booth provides an official stamp (often a red circle or oval) specifically for marking the candidates.

This process ensures high security and accountability, as voters must be physically present with their specific, government-issued ID and officially-notified polling station information.
The procedure for marking their ballot is highly standardized and simple:
1. The Official Stamp 
* Inside the voting booth, there is a large, official stamp (often a red circle or oval) and an inkpad. 
* The voter must use this official stamp to mark their choice. They must not use their personal chop, a pen, or any other mark, as this would invalidate the ballot.
2. Marking the Ballot 
* The voter is required to press the stamp into the designated blank space next to their chosen candidate’s or party’s name. 
* The stamp should be placed clearly within the box or next to the chosen candidate’s name to indicate the vote.
3. Rules for a Valid Vote
A vote is typically counted as valid if: 
* The official stamp provided in the booth is used. 
* The stamp is placed clearly in the box or next to only one candidate/party.A vote is considered invalid (or a “spoiled ballot”) if: 
* It contains any personal mark (like a signature, a fingerprint, or the voter’s personal chop). |
* The voter marks more than one choice. 
* The mark is outside of the designated space and cannot clearly be associated with a candidate. 
* The ballot is torn, soiled, or otherwise compromised.
This system of using a single, clear official stamp is designed to simplify the hand-counting process that immediately follows the poll closing, as there is less room for debate over a voter’s intent compared to handwritten marks.
