# Chapter Eight - Where We Go From Here

*"After we kick electronic voting systems out of our country, and go back to all-paper, one-day elections - we need to make Election Day a national holiday. It needs to be a holiday not for convenience or to make sure everyone has time to get to the polls. It needs to be a holiday so that once a year we will remember how Americans defeated tyranny within our borders for a second time. That we reaffirmed that our rights come from our Creator and our liberty is a responsibility. And under that framework our government derives its powers only from the consent of the governed."*

*"They don't like playing defense. They don't know how to play defense."*

—Gregg Phillips


*"Are you ready?"*

*"Yes."*

—From a conversation between Mark Cook and the author at the close of Day 3 of Mike Lindell's Cyber Symposium

This is my seventeenth year living in Minnesota, although my family returned to Stevens County each year in my youth from Texas, Gabon, Louisiana, Indonesia, and China, where my dad's work as a geophysicist brought us. In 5th grade and 7th grade (as secretary) I served in the student council, and was later named or voted captain of several sports teams, including my college soccer team which went to the NCAA tournament. After college, I worked four years in the inventory and software divisions at Target in Minneapolis before investing in myself as a freelance writer for the past eight years. I've assisted governors with a USA Today article and a military veteran with his autobiography, cowrote several books, one a Wall Street Journal bestseller, and helped about 90 authors choose the title of their book.

With a growing understanding of what happened on November 3rd, 2020, life took a turn. After working with grassroots Minnesotans seeking audits, I attended Mike Lindell's Cyber Symposium in Sioux Falls, South Dakota in August 2021. There I met people like Draza Smith, Seth Keshel, Mark Cook, and Col. Phil Waldron and also learned from people like Col. Shawn Smith, Patrick Colbeck, Joe Oltmann, and Professor David Clements. Here in Minnesota, I've continued to absorb much from people like Rick Weible and Susan Smith, as well as from those attending county commissioners meetings in Crow Wing, Morrison, Dakota, Wright and Sherburne County.

These experiences and relationships were vital in preparing me to not only make the decision to run for secretary of state in Minnesota, but also to become the servant leader necessary to resolve our election problems, preserve election integrity, and restore confidence to all Minnesota voters that their constitutional right to vote (and to not be disenfranchised of that right) is fully protected.

Outside of learning about elections, I enjoy running, gardening, and playing the piano.

Hebrews 12:1 (KJV) reads "Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us."

## What Diplomacy Teaches

A decent amount of my preparation for 2022 actually occurred starting around age 16 when I was introduced by my history teacher in Houston, Texas, to Diplomacy, a tabletop game designed by Allan B. Calhamer, [apparently played by JFK and other statesmen](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ifxjnv/do_we_know_if_jfk_or_kissinger_actually_played/) and was popularized by play by mail throughout Europe in the Sixties.

I enjoyed the game so much that I formed a club at my high school and later wrote [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Diplomacy-Conversations-Erik-van-Mechelen-ebook/dp/B07ZZMVCGR/) and recorded [an audiobook](https://www.amazon.com/Diplomacy-Conversations-Face-Face-Tournaments/dp/B08742MPJJ/).

Many of the tactics, tricks, and maneovers I've witnessed this past year I first observed or experienced playing this board game. Other games like weiqi (Go) have furthered my abstract study of war, but Diplomacy's simultaneous movement and lack of imperfect information turned out to be good practice for many interactions and communications of late.

In Diplomacy, as per the rules, cheating is allowed and there are no penalties for cheating. No verbal commitments or written contracts are binding. There are [infamous stories](http://www.diplomacy-archive.com/god.htm) of players threatening to broadcast personal secrets about their opponents if they don't agree to do what they want.

In a game with no rules against foul play, the players, including your friends who you've invited to the game, may lie to your face to gain an advantage. They may agree to help you and then help your neighbor instead.

On the surface, the game prepares one to detect liars and subtle deceptions. It teaches one to ask good questions. To listen well. It also tempts one to take what one has not earned. It teaches you that it does not feel good to stab your friend in the back, even if the game allows it and even incentivizes it.

It also teaches patience and attention to detail.

Narratives and alliances and strategic movements must sometimes be developed carefully over a handful of game years (one to two hours)—one wrong move, mistep, or miscalculation can undo that preparation or end the game for you. In one game, I'd carefully for about two hours prepared a coordinated move only to misorder (write the wrong moves), costing me the game.

A single game can sometimes last six hours or longer. In a tournament it's common to play more than one game in a day. Endurance is required.

Rare in tabletop board games, things can even get physical.

In a high stakes moment during a tournament game in Chicago in 2019, I was physically pushed as I requested a conversation from a player who was beginning to work with me but whom another player wanted to keep under his wing.

I decided not to complain.

Later I noticed the man who pushed me went to let the tournament organizer know what happened. That's what was supposed to happen from a sportsmanship perspective, even in a game where the rules specifically state there are no rules. (Therefore, house rules have to be developed by game hosts, leagues, and tournament organizers.)

In short, Diplomacy could well be part of the training to become a politician. Except, in my case, I don't want to be a politician. In his book Zero to One, Peter Thiel described politicians as people who sell themselves. Instead of a politician, I want to be a *public servant*, an elected official completely accountable to the people of Minnesota, the constitution, and to God. I know this is the intent of many others who have stepped up this year. But not everyone.

Don't let endorsements replace your critical thinking. A lot of people trusted Dr. Fauci's endorsement of various protocols and treatments who now regret substituting their God-given ability to think (and intuit) for a man's misguided opinion, to put it lightly.

Don't make this mistake with regard to supporting candidates. Even if your chosen candidate loses or their election is actually a machine (s)election, at least you will have not put your energy and effort into someone who doesn't share your convictions.

It is usually quite simple to tell the difference between someone who is sincere about saving our state and country and someone who isn't.

Fortunately, this year it is easier than ever to recognize whether a candidate is truly America First. Have they consistently said the election was stolen? Do they boldly speak the truth on the basic constitutional topics like gun rights, medical freedom, and CRT? Are they willing to respond to tough questions? And maybe most important: Have they already been working toward the outcomes they say they want to continue working on once in office? What tangible proof can they show of those efforts?

The power of your words and decisions are not to be underestimated. When you make discoveries, share them. Word of mouth spreads quickly.

If discerning the truth and speaking boldly do not come naturally to you, be not afraid and keep practicing. As President Trump said, "Never, ever, give up."

This is an information war.

All hands on deck.

It's time for us to go on the offense.
