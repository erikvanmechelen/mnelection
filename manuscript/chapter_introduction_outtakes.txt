As rumors of mysterious virus spread in early 2020, I immediately sensed a contest of ideas was about to play out. An attempt at total control was being instantiated with fear. Little did I know that an election would follow.

BIG EDIT HERE BECAUSE THIS WAS WRITTEN BY ROBERT AND IS IT TRUE FOR ME... ? 

chance to discuss how didn't understand §1550, etc. the EOs (did see the beginning of looting in St. Paul, days after George Floyd... burned building carried on the wind to our front yard miles away...)

THEN remove Colbeck sections after this, etc.

By mid-summer of 2020, videos documenting the horrors of the Chinese Cultural Revolution were circulating on YouTube. After several weeks of violence plaguing cities around the United States, loudly—though in substance quite loosely—tethered to the death of several United States citizens who the corporate media branded as victims. The corporate sponsored revolutionaries used the color of these citizen’s skin as justification for their looting, pillaging, assaulting, and killing. The corporate media and intellectual class graced these actors with the blessed heritage of “peaceful protest,” as small businesses were destroyed, communities (many of them populated by racial and ethnic minorities) gutted, and cities burned. No one seemed to bother to check the police reports. Why would they? Instagram and Facebook already told them what happened, and whose name (no matter how criminal, felonious, or murderous) to say. The same tactics the Maoist used in the previous century to upend China were on display in my home country—tearing down statues, disgracing public buildings, ridiculing our history, shaming any who would defend it. Where the American version of the red army (the black shirts) stopped short was public beheadings—perhaps knowing that the constitutional right to bear arms and form militias would put a swift end to what could be accomplished with a more measured and insidious approach.

Living in Minneapolis, the totalitarian flavor of the air, food, and water I remembered in Beijing was asserting itself in my own backyard.

After months of isolation, fear, confusion, anxiety, and frustration, with (major sporting leagues around the world shut down) nothing to watch and nowhere to go, a series of provocative images from the corner of 38th and Chicago in Minneapolis’s Powderhorn neighborhood lit a powder keg. The nation, within moments, went from “stronger together” to irredeemably and systemically racist. With half-truth history populating the minds of the highly educated and the pages of the New York Times, the Maoist attempt at unraveling of the American consciousness was now out in the open. Minneapolis would be center stage of the supposedly anti-fascist to deliver their first blow to the supposedly white supremacist fabric of our nation’s past, present, and future. Soon, the epicenter of the charade would ripple out to its final landing place in Portland where the (apparently well-funded) black shirts terrorized a city ironically praised for its leftist ideals. But while the nightly news celebrated the “mostly peaceful” protests that were plainly seen as nothing of the sort, a more profound war was raging across the country in state houses of government and county elections commissions…

From Patrick Colbeck's *The 2020 Coup: What Happend. What We Can Do.*, the preparation phase (before the attack, backup attack, and defense phases) was well under way. The elections commissions, the non-profits, the state legislatures, judicial permissions, and corporate media swirled in a whirlwind of confusion that unconstitutionally set the election to the tune they wanted to play.

By the next summer, I was working with men and women around the state searching for a way to properly and seriously audit Minnesota's election results. Being a part of that group got me an invite to the Cyber Symposium. That week in Sioux Falls, South Dakota helped me understand what was at stake. Shortly after I joined a decentralized national working group uncovering the truth about elections. Most recently my work led to county commissioner meetings in Dakota, Sherburne, and Wright County and closed door meetings with commissioners and election officials in Dakota and Morrison County. Through this work I've met Minnesotans from all walks of life fighting for their state and ultimately their lives through a dedication to the truth.

What we know now is that those who control the machines, control the results. So long as we have machines, I will not feel any confidence whatsoever that my vote was counted.

From the 100,000-foot view, elections are simply a control mechanism and also a critical vector of attack against a nation-state. Here in the United States, if by subverting elections you can install candidates up and down the ballot, then a county, state, and country can be usurped without firing a bullet. In the digital age, this can be done through machine code invisible to election judges, poll challengers, and election officials. Meanwhile, the public could be manipulated for years or decades to think all is well in our constitutional republic, when in fact we were on course to lose it and may indeed have lost it.

Of course, maintaining control by subverting elections is not new, even if this important fact is not widely understood.

In 2004, Sequoia (acquired the next year by Smartmatic in 2005), was used to run the Venezuelan presidential recall election, even though it was the company's first time providing machines for an election.

Before electronic voting machines, decades prior, in 1961, I found this airtel to the Director of the FBI while browsing the JFK files:

![Perhaps they will attempt to switch voting machines](switch_voting_machines.png)

More than a decade prior to that, in Robert A. Caro’s autobiography, *Working*, he stresses the importance of facts being made available to the public. One critical fact was that in 1948 at the eleventh hour two hundred votes were found for Lyndon B. Johnson propelling him into the Texas Senate by a margin of eighty-seven votes in a race where more than a million votes were cast. Caro found the man responsible for carrying this out, Luis Salas, who invited him into his home where he admitted to Caro what he did and that he lied under oath about it. He gave Caro a manuscript describing his actions. Caro writes, “Thanks to that manuscript, it would not be necessary for me to write, ‘No one will ever be sure if Lyndon Johnson stole it.’ He stole it.”

That was in 1948.

Like Caro, I couldn’t look away from what I was seeing in late 2020 and 2021. In Patrick Colbeck's framework, the preparation phase (creating weaknesses) had led into the attack phase (where the mail-in ballot weakness was exploited) followed by the backup attack phase (where votes were injected electronically), and we had entered the defense phase (where election evidence was covered up or destroyed).

Even despite the lack of cooperation from elected officials, locally people like Rick Weible showed me so much evidence from Minnesota that I couldn't stand aside. From others around the country sharing information with me, I gradually learned how our elections were supposed to work, and how they had been taken over. The election theft in 2020 was obviously coordinated. If this has been happening for a long time, why only now was it so obvious?

How was it that I'd so far lived my life believing my vote counted, but now could not so easily answer that question? That will take some time to unpack. But one thing is clear: Since November 3rd, 2020, tens of millions, if not more, have asked or are now beginning to ask, Does my vote count? It's only a matter of time before everyone knows.

If our election officials, counties, and secretaries of state cannot show that the computerized election management systems used to produce election results actually do so without error, then citizens in increasing numbers will have the same question—Does my vote count? Jeffrey O'Donnell puts it well in the introduction to his Mesa County #3 Report, highlighted in the forthcoming (S)election Code documentary: "If Americans' votes are to be recorded and counted by machines, every aspect of those machines' operation, configuration, and data must be recorded, immediately available at no cost or administrative burden to citizens and their independent examiners and confirmed 100% accurate through that independent verification. The absence or shortfall of any of those three imperatives (recorded, available, and independently verified) should immediately cause the public to distrust both the purported results from those machines, and also anyone who insists that they accept those results."

To date, no independent audit of the machines has been done of any Minnesota county. This would be welcome since according to Dr. Douglas Frank the ES&S DS200s are among the most vulnerable voting machines in the country.

DS200s were used in more than 60 of Minnesota's 87 counties in 2020.

In April 2021, the DS200 used in Antrim, County Michigan was found to have a [4G wireless modem installed](https://letsfixstufforg-my.sharepoint.com/personal/patrick_letsfixstuff_org/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fpatrick%5Fletsfixstuff%5Forg%2FDocuments%2FFiles%2F2020%20Election%2FLegal%2FExhibit%206%20Jim%20Penrose%20Report%2Epdf&parent=%2Fpersonal%2Fpatrick%5Fletsfixstuff%5Forg%2FDocuments%2FFiles%2F2020%20Election%2FLegal&ga=1) within the enclosure of the machine.

![Telit LE910-SV1 found within ES&S enclosure](telit.png)

Furthermore, [the exhibit describes](https://letsfixstufforg-my.sharepoint.com/personal/patrick_letsfixstuff_org/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fpatrick%5Fletsfixstuff%5Forg%2FDocuments%2FFiles%2F2020%20Election%2FLegal%2FExhibit%206%20Jim%20Penrose%20Report%2Epdf&parent=%2Fpersonal%2Fpatrick%5Fletsfixstuff%5Forg%2FDocuments%2FFiles%2F2020%20Election%2FLegal&ga=1) how the card was "utilizing a commercial Verizon SIM card with an APN configuration specific to the ES&S DS200 provisioning. Testing revealed that the same SIM card could be utilized in a separate wireless hotspot device and the device could then join the same APN as the ES&S voting machines. An unauthorized user could gain access to this APN by an extra SIM card pre-provisioned for this APN, or by removing a SIM from an operational device and using it in another device."

To repeat: This wireless modem was found on an enclosed part of the machine. Therefore if these same or similar wireless modems were also installed on the DS200s throughout Minnesota, it would be invisible to election judges, poll challengers, and even election officials.

Are you concerned that contracts with our hardware and software vendors makes it very difficult to inspect the machines or source code? Does it worry you that Minnesota Statutes make it difficult to have this done? 18 months after November 3rd, 2020, don't you think it would have been prudent to have settled the conspiracy theories by showing the public that the machines are clean?

Neither the chair of a major political party nor the secretary of state asked for a third party to inspect the source code of the machines, which [Minnesota Statute 206.57 Subd.6](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/206.57) allows for.

Furthermore, according to [Patrick Colbeck](https://letsfixstuff.org/2022/05/beware-of-just-count-the-ballots-narrative/), "only a full forensic audit of the entire election record chain of custody can determine whether or not an election was conducted with integrity."

Even with the "defense phase" of the election coup falling apart, so far no county commissions have decided to return to hand counting paper ballots as many of their constituents desire—instead, counties plan to run elections on very similar if not the same software which managed the 2020 election. This would be unwise if fair and transparent elections are desired. The people should hold their elected officials accountable beginning with their county commissioners, since elected officials in the legislature have so far failed to protect elections.

This book will follow the organization of the four phases of an election coup put forward by Patrick Colbeck in his book:

- Preparation
- Attack
- Back-up Attack
- Defense

These phases will provide the framework to put Minnesota's 2020 election in context.

In the imminent and immediate future, the machines will become unacceptable to the majority of people. Hand counting paper will be heavily demanded. Once trust is restored in hand counting paper ballots that are 100% auditable, maybe only then should alternatives to hand counting paper may be looked into. But let's take this one step at a time. Read this book and share it with anyone who doesn't yet understand how machines and malicious code determine the outcome of elections in our state and country. Every Minnesotan deserves to know the truth. Without this information, how can the public react? Once the light is shone, deception and lies will hold no power over us.
