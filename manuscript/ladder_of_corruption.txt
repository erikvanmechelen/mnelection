## Then vs. Now

EDIT EDIT EDIT

I want to close this chapter with a summary from Jeffrey O'Donnell posted on June 1, 2022, contrasting the August 2021 position with the June 2022 position.

The rest of this chapter are Jeff's words from [this post](https://t.me/ALoneRaccoon/2221):

I joined this fight full time more than nine months ago. I wilfully pushed the pause button on our lives and trusted God to provide - and he has. I have a new appreciation for the Israelites who were given manna to survive - each day's needs are supplied. The next week or month... that's where faith and trust come in. At that time, Lindell's symposium had just happened and everyone thought the pcap information would save us. We were wrong. Specifically speaking,

* the process of defining the algorithms used to sway the election was still in its infancy, with Ed Solomon and Draza Smith only just starting to be able to describe the process

* State voter rolls were being only cursorily examined, and little comparison was being done between states

* The inner workings of the election servers was still a complete mystery

* Most analysis of the 2020 fraud was being done by people within counties. Very little information was being shared between states or even counties

* The clues to the whole thing in the Edison election night reporting were seen but not yet understood

* No effort existed to collect, analyze, and share election data such as cast vote records and ballot images. The importance of Cast Vote Records in this fight was really not recognized yet.

* Although "phantom" absentee votes were suspected, their prevalence and widespread abuse was not generally known yet.

* Protecting 2022/2024, while on people's radar, had no viable plan."

Now look at today.

* the algorithm used by the election servers is well understood and can even be predicted now

* Tremendous problems with voter rolls have been loudly documented in many states.

* We have a full understanding of the internal working of the Dominion system, with other vendors soon to come.

* There is coordination and cooperation - and healthy competition - between groups in different states

* Edison has been revealed to be a conspirator in the election plot, and while much is still not understood, the "edison zero" and the flipping of votes between absentee and in-person has been well-documented, as has the fact that the reporting is largely theater and does not match up well with the actual results in a state/county until the very end,

* Cast Vote Records, ballot images, tabulator logs, voter rolls/histories and more have been obtained from many counties in many states, and their analysis has proved crucial. Any bit of data we get from a county is something they cannot destroy in September.

* Massive absentee ballot fraud is a fact.

* Findings from 2020 are being used in many ways to minimize the fraud potential in future elections... plus the identification of any fraud now takes minutes rather than months.

* Serious court cases (much better than the quick ones done right after the election) are progressing in numerous states"

Where are the arrests? Please do not be na√Øve. We are forced to be a citizen's Justice Department, because our country does not currently have a functioning one. Our burden of proof is immense and unfair. We have no subpeona or warrant power. You need to think of this for what it is - a national RICO case. Read how Guliani broke up the mobs in New York. He built his case from the ground up and quietly climbed the ladder of corruption until he had the goods on ALL the bosses. Then he struck.
